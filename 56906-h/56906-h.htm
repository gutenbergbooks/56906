<h2>A WORD TO THE READER</h2>
<p>There have been many lives of F&eacute;nelon. Four
were brought out in the eighteenth century, and two
quite extensive ones were issued as recently as 1901.
In a few cases they have been written in a spirit of
cold, supercilious disparagement and cynical comment
by people who evidently had no experience
which would qualify them to understand the character
they rashly attempted to portray. But the
endeavor to pull F&eacute;nelon down from the pedestal
on which he has so long stood can not succeed. So
long as his own writings remain to bear testimony
to the high qualities of his mind and soul, his fame
is secure. It is the chief regret of the present writer
that, owing to the restricted size of the book, he has
not been able to give more of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s own words.
The reader is recommended to procure the &ldquo;Spiritual
Letters&rdquo; of F&eacute;nelon, published in two volumes
by E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>It is not claimed that F&eacute;nelon was wholly without
faults, or was in all respects ahead of his times.
How could that be expected? He took, in the main,
of course, the Roman Catholic view in the questions
that arose regarding heresy and the general affairs
of the Church. It is not necessary to defend him
for this. We are concerned, in studying such persons,
not so much with their dogmatic opinions and
beliefs, the result of their environment, as with
the spirit of their lives, their attainments in holiness,
and the light which they can shed on the best
means of growth in grace. It is believed that the
present volume will be found helpful to this end.
The type of piety exemplified by F&eacute;nelon, Fletcher,
Faber, and others of this sort, does not appeal with
equal force to all, owing to difference of mental and
physical constitution. But all, whatever their temperament,
can get only good by contemplating such
an example as is presented in these pages. They
can not feel the quick throbs of his deeply loving
heart, and note the sincerity of purpose with which
he served his dear Redeemer, without being stimulated
in their zeal, and helped to walk, in their own
way, more worthily of the vocation with which they
themselves are called. That this may indeed be the
outcome for every reader of the following chapters,
is the earnest prayer of the author.</p>

<br />FROM YOUTH TO MANHOOD.</h2>
<p>Christian perfection, or the highest possibilities
of Christian grace and growth, is a theme of
intense interest to every true lover of the Lord.
There are many ways of promoting it, widely differing
in their merits and their helpfulness. Without
disparaging other methods, it may be safely
said that nothing can be better than example. Christianity
centers around a person; and personal experience
perennially appeals. Better than abstract
discussion is concrete practice. More profitable
than speculation and controversy is an actual life
on highest levels. There is also a large advantage
in beholding such a life in another age and land
and Church, thus noting how God can magnify and
fulfill Himself in very diverse circumstances, and
amid intellectual influences that to us are quite obnoxious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>We invite, therefore, the attention of the
thoughtful reader to a man who presents one of the
most perfect types of human purity that the world
has ever seen; one who for two hundred years has
stood among the choicest few of those universally
esteemed to be authorities in spiritual things; one
endowed with a luster which the lapse of time can
not tarnish,&mdash;a luster far brighter than can be bestowed
by mere worldly honors or temporal prosperity,
however high. He not only had a heart filled
with the love of God and glowing with pure devotion,
but also a mind capable of the closest analysis
and the keenest discrimination. He was not only a
saint, but also a scholar and a genius, an original
thinker as well as a pursuer of holiness. Such combinations
are very rare. His thirst for perfection
has probably never been surpassed. Seldom, if ever,
has such a remarkable combination of high qualities
tabernacled in the flesh. He had both modesty
and majesty, both simplicity and sublimity, unconquerable
firmness in duty, unsurpassed meekness in
society; he was equally eminent for piety and politeness,
for morals and manners; he was sympathetic
and chivalrous, severe to himself, indulgent
to others. In the midst of a voluptuous court he
practiced the virtues of an anchorite; with the
revenues of a prince at command he hardly allowed
himself ordinary comforts. His abilities awaken
our admiration, his afflictions excite our compassion.
Born among the nobility of earth, he resisted the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
blandishments of earthly pomp, and became crowned
with the far higher nobility of heaven. He was
truly humble and truly heroic; good as well as
great; skillful in teaching, wise in counsel, master
of an elegant style both in composition and discourse;
faithful to his friends and kind to his foes;
devoted to his native land, generous to his family, a
man of peace yet ready to fight for the faith, true to
his convictions, tolerant toward those of other beliefs,
tenderly affectionate, vigorously diligent; the
glory of his country, the joy of mankind, the beloved
of the Lord. He had an intense nature, and
was, as has been said, &ldquo;One whose religion must
be more loving than love, his daily life more kind
than kindness, his words truer than truth itself.&rdquo;
Lamartine calls him &ldquo;beautiful as a Raphael&rsquo;s St.
John leaning on the bosom of Christ.&rdquo; He had the
imagination of a woman for dreaming of heaven,
and the soul of a man for subduing the earth. The
especially feminine qualities were prominent in him,
yet he strikes no one as effeminate, and when he
felt himself set for the defense of the truth he
showed a power that greatly surprised his enemies.
&ldquo;His soul was like a star and dwelt apart,&rdquo; &ldquo;alone
with the Alone.&rdquo; And yet he was so deeply interested
in the welfare of France and his fellow-men
that he has been called a politician; statesman would
be the word more befitting the facts, for his ideas as
to the measures and policies necessary to make the
land prosperous were in the main very wise, and he
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
had no personal ends to serve. In whatever capacity
we consider him&mdash;poet, orator, moralist,
metaphysician, politician, instructor, bishop, friend,
persecuted Christian&mdash;he excites our keenest interest,
our warmest admiration. He greatly desired to
please every one, and succeeded so far as circumstances
allowed; but the desire was held in strictest
control by a strong sense of duty, which compelled
him at times to do and say things most unacceptable
to many. He was no courtier, no flatterer, he could
not make his own interests the first consideration.
He was a prophet in Gomorrah, charged with a message
which pressed upon him for utterance, and for
the delivery of which the time was short. At the
court of Louis XIV&mdash;a spot above all others on the
face of the earth, perhaps, in that century, disgraced
by selfishness, hypocrisy, and intrigue&mdash;he bears
not a little resemblance to a seraph sent on a divine
mission to the shades of the lost. There is endless
fascination in his story. He was not without faults,
but his faults were those of his age; his virtues were
his own. He turned a haughty, irritable, overbearing
young prince, an incipient C&aelig;sar Borgia, into
the mildest, most docile, obedient of men. He
possessed his soul in peace amid provocations that
would have been far too much for most of us.
Neither public disgrace nor personal bereavement
had power to embitter him. He listened to the voice
of God within him, and marched straight on, breast
forward. In the language of Herder, &ldquo;His Church
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
indeed canonized him not, but humanity has.&rdquo; He
is a saint in the eyes of multitudes not attracted by
official sanctity; an apostle of liberty that dared withstand
the Grand Monarque; a martyr spending half
a life in exile, through the machinations of a court
faction which dreaded his incorruptible goodness.
&ldquo;Being dead, he yet speaketh.&rdquo; &ldquo;One of the noblest
men who ever lived,&rdquo; says Dr. John Henry Kurtz,
the distinguished Church historian. Joseph de
Maistre exclaims: &ldquo;Do we wish to paint ideal greatness?
Let us try to imagine something that surpasses
F&eacute;nelon&mdash;we shall not succeed.&rdquo; Let us,
then, putting aside imagination, endeavor to rescue
from the musty record of the misty past, a lifelike
image of this many-sided, multiple, versatile personality.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class="sc">Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac de la Mothe F&eacute;nelon</span>
was born August 6, 1651, at the castle, or chateau,
of F&eacute;nelon, about three miles from the town of
Sarlat, in the department of Southern France, formerly
called Perigord, now Dordogne, north of
the river Garonne. The De Salignacs were of an
ancient and distinguished family, counting in their
long pedigree many of the best names of France&mdash;bishops,
governors, generals, and ambassadors. But
it is safe to say that they have derived more luster
from the single name of the Archbishop of Cambrai
than from all the rest who through several
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
centuries filled lofty stations in camp and court and
Church.</p>
<p>Very little is known about his parents or his
early life. Pons de Salignac, Count of La Mothe
F&eacute;nelon, father of Francis, was twice married, having
fourteen children by his first wife and three by
his second. The eldest of the three was Francis.
His mother, Mademoiselle Louise de la Cropte de
Saint-Arbre, sister of a celebrated lieutenant who
served under Marshal Turenne, is said to have been
unusually pious, which we can well believe, and to
have perpetuated some of her other traits in her
famous son. From his father&rsquo;s side he doubtless inherited
his diplomatic temperament and a goodly
degree of worldly wisdom. His peculiar situation
in the household could hardly fail to have had something
to do with his character. The numerous
grown-up sons and daughters of his father&rsquo;s first
marriage took umbrage at the second; hence the
precocious and sensitive child had abundant occasion
to practice all possible arts of ingratiation to obtain
forgiveness for having intruded his existence upon
them, and to make it pleasant for his mother. His
constitution was delicate, and he had a sickly childhood;
once at least in his early days his life was
despaired of, and he only recovered to be for years
the victim of sleeplessness and kindred ailments.
He was the idol of his old father, who, recognizing
his unusual talents, took special pains with his education.
It was intrusted at first to a private preceptor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
who seems to have been well fitted for his
task, and gave to his pupil in a few years a better
knowledge of Greek and Latin than is commonly
obtained at so early an age, doubtless laying thus
the foundation of his exquisitely finished style. At
twelve he left the paternal roof for the neighboring
University of Cahors (a town about sixty miles
north of Toulouse, containing now an obelisk of
F&eacute;nelon), where he pursued for some three years
philosophical and philological studies and took his
degrees in the arts.</p>
<p>His father probably died about this time, as we
hear nothing further of him, and his uncle, the Marquis
Antoine de F&eacute;nelon, who had lost his own son,
acted henceforth as the father of his nephew. It
was a most happy circumstance, for the marquis
was deeply religious and of an unsullied private
life, as well as very independent in his character.
The Grand Cond&eacute;, greatest general of his time, described
him as &ldquo;equally at home in society, war,
and the council chamber.&rdquo; When M. de Harlai
was nominated to the Archbishopric of Paris, the
marquis remarked to him, &ldquo;There is a wide difference,
my Right Reverend Lord, between the day
when the nomination for such an office brings to
the party the compliments of the whole kingdom,
and the day on which he appears before God to render
Him an account of his administration;&rdquo; a reflection
which, although much needed, could not have
been very agreeable to De Harlai, for he was a notorious
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
evil liver, who introduced every species of
corruption into the administration of his diocese,
and scandalized all by the iniquities also of his private
life. Another indication of the marquis&rsquo;s truly
noble quality is seen in the fact that when M. Olier,
the celebrated founder of the Congregation of St.
Sulpice, wished to form an association of gentlemen
whose courage was past impeachment, to bind
themselves with an oath neither to accept any challenge
nor act the part of second in any duel&mdash;that
the practice of dueling might thus be checked&mdash;he
asked M. de F&eacute;nelon to take the post of president
of the association, being convinced that there was
no one whose reputation was more firmly established
both in court and camp.</p>
<p>Under the guidance, then, of this admirable relative,
who was so exceptionally well fitted by character,
position, and situation to give his nephew the
best possible start in life, and who tenderly loved
him, young Francis came to Paris in 1666, at the
age of fifteen. It was not, of course, the Paris of
the present day; but even then it was a great city,
reaching back for its beginning to the Roman times,
and recognized as the seat of government for at
least a thousand years. Under Henry of Navarre
(1589-1610) great improvements had been made,
and by the accession of Louis XIV&mdash;who began to
reign nominally in 1643, at the age of five, but really
took charge of the kingdom in 1661&mdash;through the
completion of several bridges, roads, and quays,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
and the erection of various public and private palaces,
a new face had been put on the old city. It
was already the focus of European civilization,
learning, and eloquence, as well as the center of all
that was most attractive and distinguished in
France. The best institutions were there, the best
opportunities for advancement, the highest privileges
and advantages of every sort; so that to it
naturally gravitated all who wished to make the
most of themselves under the eye of that Grand
Monarch whose favor was life. Francis, therefore,
no doubt counted himself greatly blessed at this
change, and entered upon his Parisian life&mdash;which
was to last thirty-one years&mdash;with very high, ambitious
hopes. His guardian sent him for two years
to the Coll&eacute;ge du Plessis, then under the rule of
M. Gobinet, a first-rate principal. There he speedily
distinguished himself as a scholar, and he also gave
such tokens of possessing the gift of eloquence that
before he was sixteen he was put forward to preach
to an admiring audience. It is, perhaps, worth noting
that Bossuet&mdash;who was so soon to be closely associated
with F&eacute;nelon, at first in friendship, then in
fierce hostility&mdash;also preached at the same age, with
similar applause, before a brilliant assemblage in
Paris.</p>
<p>What was the next step? A noble under Louis
XIV had two possible careers open to him, and only
two; they were the army and the Church. It is not
probable that the matter was long debated, if at all,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
in Francis&rsquo; case. Everything about him, his gifts of
speech, his high scholarship, his deep piety, his
rather delicate health, pointed to the clerical vocation,
and there can be no question but this was with
him a divine calling, to which doubtless his heart
gave full assent. So he was placed, in 1688, at the
seminary of St. Sulpice to be trained for the priesthood.</p>
<p>Since he was to spend no less than ten happy
years, in the formative period of seventeen to twenty-seven,
in connection with this institution, it may
be well that we say a few words about it and its
director. It was the principal fruit of the great
Catholic revival at the beginning of the century,
the embodiment of all the force of that movement&mdash;a
movement marked by very earnest piety and a
somewhat unusual combination of emotionalism and
asceticism. It was founded by a group of devoted
men sprung from the upper-middle class; and chief
among them was M. Olier, a man justly celebrated
for his saintly life. He was appointed in 1642 to
the parish of St. Sulpice when it was noted as the
most depraved quarter of Paris. He labored unremittingly
and very successfully to reform this unpromising
flock, and the young priests who were
associated with him in his task constituted the nucleus
of the seminary and community of St. Sulpice.
The necessary building to house the institution,
to the establishment of which Monsieur Olier
gave himself with highest enthusiasm, was completed
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
in 1652&mdash;a square edifice capable of receiving
one hundred inmates. This became the center of
a most wholesome and inspiring activity.</p>
<p>The founder had a very high ideal of sacerdotal
character. He would not admit any who embraced
the sacred calling from considerations of ambition
or expediency, and those admitted were subjected
to the sharpest kind of tests. Whatever their birth
or condition they were required to perform the
menial duties of the house, and to mingle on terms
of absolute equality with their fellow-students. The
complete immolation of self was set as the paramount
aim before those who looked forward to holy
orders. The will must be entirely surrendered.
The good priest must become the model of all the
virtues. All earthly interests and ties must be renounced.
The closest union with the Divine was
to be cultivated. A very literal interpretation of
the teaching of the Master was followed. The
pupils were urged to study the Gospels till they
could bring the Divine life before them at any moment
in a series of mental pictures which should
help them in the decision of all perplexing questions
of duty, and were exhorted to keep themselves in
such a disposition that meditation on that model
life would never seem strange or demand a violent
mental revulsion whatever their outward circumstances
might be. While the ceremonies of the
Church were observed with minute exactness, and
occasional austerities were practiced, and learning
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
was not neglected, the main thought was that the
perfection of personal character must be secured at
all costs; the world was to be abandoned, the flesh
crucified, the devil in all his forms resisted, and
lessons of humility, obedience, and charity were to
be most carefully learned. They were taught that
in the silence which succeeds the struggle of self-abandonment
they would find Christ coming to
them&mdash;the Christ who had borne all and understood
all, and whose presence was far more worth
having than the prizes they had missed or put away.</p>
<p>It can well be believed that this wholly consecrated
man, the first superior of St. Sulpice, won
to himself so large a share of personal affection
and loyalty from his students that when he was removed
from its care many feared its collapse. But
this was not to be. A suitable successor was found
in M. Louis Tronson, a man every way as capable
as the first founder&mdash;indeed more learned in theology&mdash;and
fully disposed to continue the traditions
of the institution as already laid down; a man
who coveted no external recognition, joined in no
race for preferment, but gave himself with singleness
of eye to the great work intrusted to him by
the Master. It was to his care that Francis F&eacute;nelon
was committed, and he speedily won the enthusiastic
affection of the young man. In a few years F&eacute;nelon
writes concerning his teacher to Pope Clement
XI as follows: &ldquo;Never have I seen his equal for
piety and prudence, for love of justice and insight
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
into character. I glory in the thought that I was
brought up under his wing.&rdquo; F&eacute;nelon was evidently
one of the Abb&eacute; Tronson&rsquo;s favorites, for he was a
favorite with everybody, and all could see in the
brilliant youth a promise that would do honor to
those who had a share in his development. A high
degree of confidence was given and received on both
sides. Francis wrote to his uncle, in a burst of
gratitude, one day: &ldquo;I earnestly desire to be able
to tell you some part of all that passes between M.
Tronson and me; but indeed, Monsieur, I know not
how to do so. I find I can be much more explicit
with him than with you, nor would it be easy to
describe the degree of union we have reached. If
you could hear our conversation you would not
know your pupil, and you would see that God has
very marvelously helped on the work which you begun.
My health does not improve, which would
be a great trial to me if I were not learning how to
comfort myself.&rdquo; This was very beautiful, very
delightful, and though such complete dominance of
one personality by another is not devoid of danger,
the results in this case appear to have justified the
experiment. Francis&rsquo; early bent to deep piety was
greatly intensified during these years, and his views
of disinterested or perfect love, so strongly brought
out in later times, were scarcely more than the natural
evolution of the thoughts and habits drilled into
him during this formative period. He greatly enjoyed
this home of piety and study. His love for
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
the seminary never decayed. He declared on his
death-bed that he knew of no institution more venerable
or more apostolic.</p>
<p>It was while at the seminary that F&eacute;nelon
thought he had a call to the mission field. The
congregation of St. Sulpice had a large missionary
establishment at Montreal, and many of the students
from the Paris house had gone thither. It
was natural, with his intense unworldliness, that
he should wish to follow in their footsteps, and in
one of his descent it would not be surprising if
the love of adventure was unconsciously mingled
with a more religious ambition to show his love for
the Savior by doing a great work for Him in a difficult
field. How many have had these longings, but
have been providentially prevented from carrying
them out! In F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s case difficulties at once
sprung up. His uncle, the Marquis Antoine,
strongly objected on account of the delicacy of his
constitution, and another uncle, the Bishop of Sarlat,
coincided with this opinion. A letter on the
subject to the bishop from M. Tronson, dated February,
1667, says, &ldquo;His strong, persisting inclination,
the firmness of his resolution, and the purity
of his intentions have made me feel that they deserved
attention, and led me to give you as exact
a report as may be of our action in the matter.&rdquo;
The teacher had done his very best to dissuade the
youth from his purpose. &ldquo;I have told him plainly
that if he can calm his longings and be quiet, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
might, by going on with his studies and spiritual
training, become more fitted to work usefully hereafter
for the Church.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;I perceive too
confirmed a resolution to have much hope of
change.&rdquo; The feelings called out were so strong
that persuasion seemed useless, and so the teacher
appealed to the authority of the guardians; which
proved sufficient to stop the rash enterprise.</p>
<p>But the missionary impulse still burned strongly
in the breast of this enthusiastic youth, and it burst
forth again a few years later. He received the
tonsure, and entered holy orders in 1675, at the age
of twenty-four, and went for a while to work in the
diocese of his uncle, the Bishop of Sarlat. It was
at this time that his thoughts were turned to the
Levant. A letter of October 9, 1675, sets forth
somewhat rhapsodically his excited feelings: &ldquo;I
long to seek out that Areopagus whence St. Paul
preached the unknown God to heathen sages....
Neither will I forget thee, O island consecrated by
the heavenly visions of the beloved disciple! O
blessed Patmos, I will hasten to kiss the footsteps
left on thee by the apostle, and to imagine heaven
open to my gaze!... Already I see schism
healed; East and West reunited; Asia awaking to
the light after her long sleep; the Holy Land, once
trodden by our Savior&rsquo;s feet and watered by his
blood, delivered from profaners and filled with new
glory; the children of Abraham, more numerous
than the stars, now scattered over the face of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
earth, gathered from all her quarters to confess the
Christ they crucified, and to rise again with him.&rdquo;
This was decidedly visionary, and somewhat overwrought;
but it shows at least a heart on fire to do
something extraordinary for God, and this he had
at all periods of his life. He did not go to Greece
and Palestine, abandoning the project in deference
to the wishes of his family, to whom he was extremely
reluctant to give pain. It was a romantic
dream rather than a true vocation.</p>
<p>It is thought by some that he really went to
Montreal at a later date. The <i>Correspondence Litteraire</i>
of July 25, 1863,<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> gives a letter from the
archives of the French Ministry of Marine in the
handwriting of Colbert, the great Finance Minister
of Louis XIV, who also had charge of the department
of commerce, dated in 1675, to Frontenac,
Governor of Canada, in which Louis XIV says:
&ldquo;I have blamed the action of Abb&eacute; F&eacute;nelon, and
have ordered him not to return to Canada. But
I ought to say to you that it was difficult to institute
a criminal proceeding against him or oblige the
priests of the seminary of St. Sulpice at Montreal
to testify against him; and it was necessary to remit
the case to his bishop or the grand vicar to
punish him by ecclesiastical penalties, or to arrest
him and send him back to France by the first ship.&rdquo;
There was not then in France any other abb&eacute; of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
that name, so far as is known. Somewhat confirmatory
of it is the fact that Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclopedia, in
its account of the Society of St. Sulpice says, &ldquo;In
1668 the Sulpicians, Fran&ccedil;ois de F&eacute;nelon and
Claude Trouv&eacute;, founded the first Iroquois mission
at the western extremity of Lake Ontario, but their
labors were confined principally to the Indians near
Montreal.&rdquo; The dates do not harmonize; but it
may be that, in some irregular way that did not
commend itself to the authorities, our hero was
for a time in Canada; but if so, it is very singular
that it left so little trace upon his life.</p>
<p>He gave himself for some three years after his
ordination to labors in the parish of St. Sulpice,
living still at the seminary, and endeavoring to
spread the light of his faith among the poor wherever
he could reach them best, whether in prisons
and hospitals or their own quarters. It was good
training for him in many ways, enlarging his sympathies,
deepening his views of life, and bringing
him into touch with children as well as women.
Doubtless he gathered in these years&mdash;for he had
quick powers of observation and a very active mind&mdash;much
of that amazing knowledge concerning these
classes which surprised his friends when he came
subsequently to pour forth in letters or books the
wisest of counsels on education and kindred topics.
M. Languet, cur&eacute; of the parish at this time, was
said to distribute more than a million francs in alms
yearly, while his own room was furnished with
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
nothing more than a coarse bed and two straw
chairs. Under such guidance F&eacute;nelon could not
fail to learn many useful lessons, and to become
still more completely fitted for the great career
which was soon to open before him.</p>
<p>It was in 1678 that F&eacute;nelon, while attending
quietly to his duties at the parish of St. Sulpice,
preaching on Sundays and visiting among the poor
during the week, received the important appointment
of superior to the community called the Nouvelles
Catholiques, or New Catholics. He was
twenty-seven at this time, and had developed into a
very lovable, charming, attractive, and every way
promising young man. His high birth, solid education,
brilliant parts, spotless life, eloquence of
speech, and influential friends, all tended to bring
him forward into the public eye. The words of
the Chancellor d&rsquo;Aguesseau on F&eacute;nelon, found in
the memoirs of the life of his father, although applying
perhaps in fullest measure a little later, may
be inserted here, as showing what it must have been
felt, by discerning observers, he would erelong become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F&eacute;nelon,&rdquo; says the chancellor, &ldquo;was one of
those uncommon men who are destined to give luster
to their age; and who do equal honor to human nature
by their virtues, and to literature by their
superior talent. He was affable in his deportment
and luminous in his discourse, the peculiar qualities
of which were a rich, delicate, and powerful
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
imagination, but which never let its power be felt.
His eloquence had more of mildness in it than of
vehemence; and he triumphed as much by the
charms of his conversation as by the superiority of
his talents. He always brought himself to the level
of his company; he never entered into disputation,
and he sometimes appeared to yield to others at the
very time that he was leading them. Grace dwelt
upon his lips. He discussed the greatest subjects
with facility; the most trifling were ennobled by
his pen; and upon the most barren he scattered the
flowers of rhetoric. The peculiar but unaffected
mode of expression which he adopted made many
persons believe that he possessed universal knowledge
as if by inspiration. It might indeed have been
almost said that he rather invented what he knew
than learned it. He was always original and creative,
imitating no one, and himself inimitable. A
noble singularity pervaded his whole person, and
a certain undefinable and sublime simplicity gave to
his appearance the air of a prophet.&rdquo; His personal
appearance has been well sketched by one of his contemporaries,
the Duke de St. Simon, a satirical, misanthropical,
utterly worldly man. &ldquo;F&eacute;nelon,&rdquo; says
St. Simon, &ldquo;was a tall man, thin, well-made, and
with a large nose. From his eyes issued the fire
and animation of his mind, like a torrent; and his
countenance was such that I never yet beheld any
one similar to it, nor could it ever be forgotten if
once seen. It combined everything, and yet with
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
everything in harmony. It was grave, and yet alluring;
it was solemn, and yet gay; it bespoke equally
the theologian, the bishop, and the nobleman.
Everything which was visible in it, as well as in
his whole person, was delicate, intellectual, graceful,
becoming, and, above all, noble. It required an
effort to cease looking at him. All the portraits are
strong resemblances, though they have not caught
that harmony which was so striking in the original,
and that individual delicacy which characterized
each feature. His manners were answerable to his
countenance. They had that air of ease and urbanity
which can be derived only from intercourse
with the best society, and which diffused itself over
all his discourse. He possessed a natural eloquence,
graceful and finished, and a most insinuating yet
noble and proper courtesy; an easy, clear, agreeable
utterance; a wonderful power of explaining the
hardest matters in a lucid, distinct manner. Add
to all this that he was a man who never sought to
seem cleverer than those with whom he conversed,
who brought himself insensibly to their level, putting
them at their ease, and enthralling them so that one
could neither leave him nor distrust him, nor help
seeking him again. It was this rare gift which he
possessed to the utmost degree which bound all
his friends so closely to him all his life in spite of
his disgrace at court, and which led them, when
scattered, to gather together to talk of him, regret
him, long after him, and cling more and more to
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
him, like the Jews to Jerusalem, and sigh and hope
for his return, even as that unhappy race waits and
sighs for their Messiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The community of the New Catholics had been
founded in 1634 by Archbishop Gondi, as a protection
for women converted from Protestantism, and
as a means of propagating Church teachings among
those yet unconverted. It was conducted by a community
of women who did the work of Sisters of
Charity outside its walls, and was presided over
by a priest selected by the Archbishop of Paris.
Marshal Turenne, himself a recent convert, gave
largely to it, and the king, who was willing to combine
gentle means with harsh for the accomplishment
of his purposes in bringing all his subjects into
one faith, took great interest in it. Hitherto the
post of superior had been filled by much older men,
but, though only twenty-seven, F&eacute;nelon was found
to combine all those qualities which fitted him for
the employment&mdash;distinguished talents, education,
amiable manners, unusual prudence and discretion,
much love to God, and great benevolence to man.
The archbishop who selected him, M. de Harlai,
was, as we have already noted, by no means of
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s stamp. He was a courtier, a man of the
world, regardless of morality, and ever scheming
for his own advancement. Having noted the capability
of F&eacute;nelon, perhaps he thought, by making
him a sort of proteg&eacute;, he could attach him to his
interests, obtain credit by his successes, and use him
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
for his purposes. But if he thought this he did not
show his usual discernment; for F&eacute;nelon, though
willing to accept the office assigned, which gave
promise of large usefulness, was in no way attracted
by the character of his patron, and no considerations
of expediency could induce him to pay court
in that direction. Consequently, De Harlai&rsquo;s early
liking changed erelong to pronounced enmity. He
noticed the absence of F&eacute;nelon from his levees, and
when he did present himself at a certain reception,
rebuked him with the words, &ldquo;It seems that you desire
to be forgotten, M. l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;, and you will be.&rdquo;
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s friendship also with Bossuet became established
about this time, and this doubtless increased
the animosity of the archbishop, as the two
were rivals for the favor of the king, on which the
coveted promotion to the cardinalate, which each
desired, so largely depended.</p>
<p>It was probably owing, somewhat at least, to
this unfriendly influence on the part of De Harlai
that F&eacute;nelon received no appointment which could
supply him with funds; for the post of Superior carried
no salary, and until 1681 he continued to be
entirely dependent for everything upon his uncle,
the marquis. In that year his uncle, the Bishop of
Sarlat, resigned to him the deanery of Carenac, at
Quercy, on the Dordogne, and this small benefice,
producing between 3,000 and 4,000 livres annually&mdash;about
$2,000 a year of modern money&mdash;was the
only revenue F&eacute;nelon possessed for a long time,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
until, indeed, his forty-third year. On leaving the
Sulpician seminary, he took up his abode with his
uncle, the Marquis de F&eacute;nelon, in the Abbey of St.
Germain, and gave himself up as entirely to his
work as if he had not been brought into so much
closer proximity to the court and the world of Paris.
He avoided general society, only living intimately
with some few chosen friends. His uncle was able
to introduce him into a rare circle, prominent in
which were the Duke and Duchess of Beauvilliers,
and the Duke and Duchess of Chevreuse (the two
ladies were sisters, daughters of the great finance
minister, Colbert), Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, and
Madame de Maintenon. We must say a few words
about these people, for they had much to do with
F&eacute;nelon through all his subsequent life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke de Beauvilliers,&rdquo; says St. Simon,
&ldquo;was early touched by God, and never lost His
presence, but lived entirely in the future world, indifferent
to place and cabal and worldly advantage,
content, when called to the council-board, simply
to state his true opinion, without much caring
whether it was followed or not.&rdquo; Punctual and orderly
almost to excess, he controlled his household
with vigilant kindness, and took on his shoulders, as
the king himself bore witness, a load of administrative
details that would have killed four other
men. In society he was rather shy and stiff by
nature, as well as on principle exceedingly careful
to set a close guard on eyes and ears and lips, so
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
that even when, as a principal minister, he was the
observed of all observers, surrounded by princes and
nobles, he repelled by his reserve. He had been at
court nearly all his life, having early succeeded
Marshal Villeroy as head of the Council of Finance,
and being also first gentleman of the chamber. He
had also been governor of Havre. He was called
to the treasury in 1685, and to the council-board in
1691. He was acknowledged on all sides to be a
man of remarkable piety and purity of life, and, as
a courtier, without reproach&mdash;a very rare thing in
those days. His chief fault was his timidity, and
his excessive subserviency to the king. But when
his conscience was aroused he could show a boldness
that was most admirable, and all the more to
be commended because somewhat foreign to his
nature. He remained true as steel to F&eacute;nelon to
his dying day, his friendship never wavering or
showing diminution, even when the latter was banished
from court, and all his friends were in a measure
under the ban because of the king&rsquo;s fierce anger.
In later years the king did his best to separate the
two, even sending for the duke and explicitly threatening
him with a like fate to that of his friend if
he did not give him up. But the duke replied, with
dignity and feeling: &ldquo;Sire, you have placed me
where I am, and you can displace me. I shall accept
the will of my sovereign as the voice of God,
and I should retire from court at your bidding regretting
your displeasure, but hoping to lead a more
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
peaceful life in retirement.&rdquo; This manly, uncompromising
stand made a deep impression on the
king, who, in spite of his liking for his own way,
knew that he could hardly afford to spare so faithful
and conscientious a servant; nothing more was
said about the matter.</p>
<p>His brother-in-law, the Duke de Chevreuse, was
different in disposition, though equally devoted to
religion. He was abler, broader-minded, better informed,
more genial and witty, but less systematic,
and a very poor business man. He had no fixed
hours for anything, and was always behindhand.
Had it not been for the king he must have died a
beggar; for he had little of his own, and his wife&rsquo;s
large fortune was wasted on costly but futile experiments,
such as canals made at enormous expense
to float down the timber from woods which
he sold before even a tree was felled. He was
charming in his manners, and was not simply loved,
but adored by his family, and friends, and servants.
Throughout his troubles, which were many, he was
never for a moment cast down, but offered up his
all to God and fixed his eyes on Him. &ldquo;Never man
possessed his soul in peace as he did,&rdquo; wrote St.
Simon, &ldquo;as the Scripture says, &lsquo;He carried it in his
hands.&rsquo;&rdquo; He was even nearer to F&eacute;nelon in some
ways than the other duke, and equally stanch in his
attachment. He had no special portfolio in the
ministry, but was consulted by the king about most
departments, and was very highly esteemed by him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The two sisters, wives of these dukes&mdash;there
were indeed three, the third having married the
Duke de Mortemart, but of this family we hear
almost nothing&mdash;were linked by the strongest bonds
of sympathy and affection, and the three families
lived in the closest union of principle and action,
which gave them great strength amid the profligate,
time-serving court. Twice a week there were dinners
at the Hotel de Beauvilliers, where the society
was at once select, intellectual, and devout. A bell
was on the table, and no servant was present, that
they might converse without restraint. It was in
this society that F&eacute;nelon, being introduced, became
speedily the leader. He was accepted by the two
dukes, not as director simply but as spiritual master,
as the mind of their mind, says St. Simon, the
soul of their soul, the sovereign ruler of their heart
and conscience. Such he remained all his days.
F&eacute;nelon and the Beauvilliers had not been long acquainted
before the duchess, mother of eight daughters,
begged him to set down some rules for the
guidance of their education. This request is a
proof not only of the versatility of his powers, but
of the strength of his faculty of intuition, that a
court lady should have turned to him for help in
such matters. He had been educated from childhood
to his sacred calling, shut off from any experience
of some of the strongest of life&rsquo;s influences,
and therefore on some accounts might seem poorly
fitted to prove an apt adviser; but it was strongly
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
felt that he possessed the secret of truest wisdom,
that what he taught was drawn from too high a
source to be greatly affected by the limits of personal
experience. Throughout his life, indeed, it
was his power of sympathy, of entering into the
difficulties of others, of realizing temptations that
can never have been present with him, that made
his influence so comprehensive&mdash;a power rarer and
more marvelous than the greatest of intellectual
gifts.</p>
<p>The work on the education of girls, which grew
out of the duchess&rsquo;s request, swelled into a considerable
compass, and was first published in 1687. It
greatly increased his reputation, revealing a knowledge
of child-nature which was most remarkable,
and taking advanced ground in many particulars.
He showed himself a thoroughgoing reformer,
breaking away from the trammels of medi&aelig;val education
that so long and so disastrously had ruled.
There is hardly a page of it which might not afford
profitable study for parents at the present day. It
still holds a high position among works on this subject.
His deep love for children sharpened his keen
observation of all that concerned them. He severely
reprobated the fashion of leaving them with
uneducated persons; for he regarded the earliest
years as of unspeakable importance in the formation
of character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never let them show themselves off,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;but do not be worried by their questions; rather
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
encourage them; they are the most natural opportunities
of teaching.&rdquo; He discovered that children
are always watching others, endowed with a great
faculty of imitation, so that it is impossible to over-estimate
the responsibility of their first guardians.
He recognized the necessity of discipline; but if the
child has merited disgrace, he pleads that there
should be some one to whom she can turn for sympathy,
thus showing that he had fathomed that overwhelming
sense of loneliness which is one of childhood&rsquo;s
chief terrors. He says: &ldquo;Make study pleasant,
hide it under a show of liberty and amusement.
Let the children interrupt their lessons
sometimes with little jokes; they need such distraction
to rest their brain. Never fear to give them
reasons for everything. Never give extra lessons
as a punishment.&rdquo; His method was to treat children
as reasonable beings instead of unruly animals
whom it was necessary to coerce against their will;
and his object was to make them regard learning
as a privilege and delight, not as a penance forced
upon them by the tyranny of their elders. He made
religion the groundwork of all education, but he
would have it guarded against superstition. He
stood strongly for the true, best rights of women,
counting their occupations no less important to the
public than those of men. He would give the young
girl useful solid tastes that would fill her mind with
real interests and prevent idle curiosity and the
dissipations of romance-reading. &ldquo;Give them something
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
to manage, on condition that they give you an
account of it,&rdquo; he pleads; &ldquo;they will be delighted
with the confidence, for it gives an incredible pleasure
to the young when one begins to rely upon them
and admit them to serious concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This will suffice to show something of the trend
of his work. Much that he urged is, of course, commonplace
now, but it was not so in his day. He
shows in his book so much knowledge of the needs
and characteristics of little children not only, but of
the special difficulties and infirmities of women,
that it remains a marvel where, at this period of
his life, he could have gained such insight into both.
And all is illumined with his beautiful style and
gentle spirit. Mr. John Morley remarks, &ldquo;When
we turn to modern literature from F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s pages,
who does not feel that the world has lost a sacred
accent, as if some ineffable essence had passed out
from our hearts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame de Maintenon has been mentioned as
one of the little circle to whose intimacy F&eacute;nelon
was introduced when beginning his Parisian career.
The full particulars of her remarkable history must
be sought in larger works. Yet it is essential that
we know something concerning her, since for a
while she was one of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s best supporters, and
then became one of his most persistent foes. She
was the grandchild of Theodore Agrippa d&rsquo;Aubigne,
a noted Protestant warrior and a noble friend of
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
Henry of Navarre, who died at Geneva in 1630.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
Her father was a scamp, her mother a jailer&rsquo;s
daughter. She was a stout Protestant in her
younger days, but being left penniless at an early
age, and wholly dependent upon charitable relatives,
she was placed in a Parisian convent, and
there converted to Catholicism. She was still only
seventeen and uncommonly good-looking when, to
escape the pressure of dependence, she consented
to become the wife of Scarron, a writer of comic
poetry and a cripple. So Frances d&rsquo;Aubigne became
Madame Scarron, and somewhat improved her
position. Her husband died in five years, leaving
her a pension. Falling in with Madame de Montespan,
the king&rsquo;s mistress, that lady took a liking to
her, and it was not long before she was established
at a fine house in one of the suburbs, with a large
income and a numerous staff of servants, as governess
of the king&rsquo;s illegitimate children by this mistress.
At the end of four years the children, with
their governess, were housed in the palace, and the
influence of the said governess over the king, who
was naturally thrown much in contact with her,
steadily increased. By the savings from her salary
and the presents of the king she was able to purchase
the estate of Maintenon, not far from Paris,
and the king, who never had liked the harsh name
of Scarron, soon began to call her Madame de Maintenon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
which henceforth became her title. In the
midst of all the vicissitudes of her life she had
maintained a good character, inheriting much from
her grandfather, and now she became yet more austere
in her piety. The Abb&eacute; Gobelin, a severe
Jesuit confessor, directed her conscience, and Bossuet
impressed his strong personality upon her.
They persuaded her that she was the chosen instrument
for the conversion of the king. So she set
herself to the task, finding it on many accounts congenial,
and achieving a remarkable degree of success.
There seems to have been in the complex
character of the king, in spite of his many sins, no
little regard for religion&mdash;it is said that he never
missed going to mass but once in his life&mdash;and he
was already weary of Montespan, whose influence
on him was unquestionably evil. So the new influence
more and more prevailed; the mistress was
dismissed to a convent, and the wise, devout, good-looking
governess became a power at court, first
lady in waiting to the crown princess, and female
friend to the monarch. The king spent hours daily
in her company, and was the better for it. She
was a strict moralist, and none of the slanders rife
about her seem to have any good foundation. She
enjoyed the respect of the best people about the
court, and was a friend of the neglected queen, who
cried, &ldquo;Providence has raised up Madame de Maintenon
to bring my husband back to me.&rdquo; And this
new favorite, who was not a mistress, believed
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
abundantly in the divine nature of her mission. She
accepted the king&rsquo;s friendship to give him good
counsels and end his slavery to vice. The care of
his salvation became the first and most absorbing
of her duties. She held herself a monitress, charged
to encourage and console him, or to check him with
reproaches that none but she dared utter. He
called her &ldquo;Your Seriousness.&rdquo; She never annoyed
him with opposition, never encroached, had no will
of her own, but became, as it were, the king&rsquo;s conception
of his better self, his second conscience, a
magnet quick to draw him, sometimes into the
really worthier of two opposing courses, always
into the more ecclesiastically virtuous. The queen
died in her arms in 1683. Two years after, she
was privately married to the king by the Archbishop
of Paris in the presence of P&egrave;re Lachaise, the king&rsquo;s
confessor, after whom the famous cemetery in
Paris is named. Such was the woman who ruled
at Versailles when F&eacute;nelon came into office. He
excited her interest on their first meeting, at or before
1683; for she wrote, under that date, to
Madame de St. Geran: &ldquo;Your Abb&eacute; de F&eacute;nelon is
very well received; but the world does not do him
justice. He is feared; he wishes to be loved; and
is lovable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must briefly introduce one more personage to
our readers before we can safely resume the current
of the narrative. Jacques B&eacute;nigne Bossuet,
who was for a while F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s friend and then became
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the bitterest of his foes, was born at Dijon,
1627. In his boyhood he was a brilliant scholar.
At Paris he soon surpassed his teachers in acquirements.
He took the Doctor&rsquo;s bonnet in 1652, and
in the same year was received into priest&rsquo;s orders.
He was first canon to the cathedral of Metz; in
1669, Bishop of Condom; in 1681, bishop of Meaux.
In 1670 he was appointed preceptor to the dauphin,
and gave most of his time for ten years to this office,
resigning his bishopric for the purpose. In
the pulpit his oratorical powers elicited universal
applause. His celebrated Funeral Discourses, six
in number, were, and still are, accounted masterpieces
of rhetorical skill. Two words, strength and
majesty, describe the dominant characteristics of
his oratory. He had a mind well stored with noble
sentiments. His sermons were almost entirely extempore,
springing from a mind filled with his subject,
guided by a few notes on paper. Attracted by
the strength and sublimity of the Bible he moved
largely within its circle of thought, rather than with
saints, relics, and images, which were for the most
part below the plane of his vision. Besides being
one of the first preachers of the age, he was a celebrated
polemic and a powerful writer, having also
a Roman aptitude to rule. One of the strongest
personalities which the French Church has produced,
he exercised a commanding influence in various
directions. The principles of Gallicanism as opposed
to Ultramontanism found in him their stalwart
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
champion. He was a famous apologist. His
knowledge was completely at command, so that he
did not shrink from oral disputation with the most
learned adversaries. And he wielded a very strong
pen. His &ldquo;Exposition of the Catholic Faith&rdquo; presents
the doctrines of Rome in a liberal and plausible
form. In his &ldquo;History of the Variations of the
Protestant Churches,&rdquo; and also in other treatises,
he made out what was considered at the time a very
strong defense of the Roman Catholic faith, but he
has since been convicted, not merely of inaccuracy,
but of false and garbled quotations. He died in
1704.</p>
<p>Bossuet, it will be seen, was twenty-four years
older than F&eacute;nelon, and for a time was almost a
father to him. At the zenith of his great reputation
he was much attracted by the younger man and
took great pains to attach him to himself. He invited
him often, with one or two others, to his
country residence at Germigny. They had stated
hours of prayer and private study and relaxation,
and in these last periods the bishop took pleasure in
unfolding to his humbler companions all his sacred
and literary stores of knowledge. Nothing could
exceed the bishop&rsquo;s regard for F&eacute;nelon, or F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
fondness for the bishop. The intercourse with
a masculine intellect so much more developed than
his own was, no doubt, a benefit to F&eacute;nelon, as
well as a high compliment to him, for it compelled
him to think for himself and brace himself somewhat
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
in order to take a worthy part in the conversation.
One can but regret that the friendship which
seemed so suitable, and was prolific of such advantage
to the Church, as well as mutual pleasure between
these two great and good men, should in a
few years, largely through misapprehensions and
verbal disagreements, have been turned to bitterness
and scandal.</p>
<p>It is probable that the ten years during which
F&eacute;nelon held the post of superior at the New Catholics
was the sunniest of his life. It was at least
the freest from difficulties and complications. He
was discovering the large possibilities of his own
powers, developing healthfully in all directions, with
a pleasant occupation, bright prospects, and an ever-widening
circle of friends, who looked to him as an
influence for good, and increasingly hung upon his
words. He was called in this period to mourn the
loss of his dear uncle, the marquis, who had been in
many ways, both spiritually and temporally, such
a help to him, and who passed away October 8,
1683. Just how much he had to do in these years
at the convent is not clear. It seems likely that he
was little more than warden or visitor, in general
charge of the instruction, the other matters being
managed by the mother superior acting under the
minute directions of the government. For converting
to the old faith those who had been born and
trained in heresy&mdash;many of them, it would appear,
brought there early, against their will, or in violation
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
of the proper rights of their parents&mdash;F&eacute;nelon
was marvelously equipped, knowing the controversy
perfectly, and knowing also what points
to touch upon with infinite tact, what appeals would
be most effective in individual cases, what arguments
to use, what influences to exert, what spirit to
exhibit. He undoubtedly proved himself the tenderest
and most persuasive of advocates and ministers,
modifying, so far as possible, the harshness
of the state which he was powerless to prevent.</p>
<p>It was his success at the head of this institution
which called forth the next commission with which
the king honored him, and which brought him into
yet closer connection with the troubled current of
affairs. In order the better to understand it we
shall do well to pause at this point and consider for
a little the ecclesiastical and political condition of
France, and to some degree of the world at large.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br />THE SETTING OF THE PICTURE.</h2>
<p>It is absolutely essential, in studying any character,
that we take into careful account the age and
land in which he lived. We can not rightly estimate
his merits or demerits unless we know the circumstances
under which he was brought up, and the influences
to which he was subjected. The background
of the picture has large importance for
showing off in proper light the principal figure.
The setting of the gem has something to do with
our appreciation of its value. Deeds which in one
century would cover their perpetrator with infamy,
in another would be regarded as wholly excusable.
The amount of light afforded strictly measures the
amount of guilt involved. Unavoidable ignorance
exculpates. Fullness of knowledge imposes responsibility.
No greater mistake could be made
than to judge people irrespective of their surroundings.
Moreover, it adds immensely to our interest
in any person if we can, to some degree at least,
look out upon the world with his eyes, see what he
saw, and so be helped to feel as he felt. We become
the better acquainted with him in proportion
as we are able to put ourselves in his place. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
can certainly estimate him more equitably according
as we reproduce to our mind the scenes of his day.</p>
<p>This being so, before we go further with the
personal history of F&eacute;nelon the Saint we shall do
well to spend a little while familiarizing ourselves
with the world of his day both civil and ecclesiastical.
How were matters in Church and State during
the period in which this great man flourished?
What was going on among the nations in general,
and in France particularly? A brief survey seems
necessary to give us the right point of view. Since
F&eacute;nelon was born in 1651, the second half of the
seventeenth century would appear to be in the main
his epoch. What was the condition of things
throughout Christendom then?</p>
<p>In America the middle of the seventeenth century
saw the English making good their foothold
on the rude Atlantic shore, in Virginia, Massachusetts,
New York, and a few other points, contending
with the Indians, the Dutch, and the home
government, jealous of their liberties, extending
their trade, and inaugurating great enterprises. It
was in 1656 that the Quakers arrived in Boston. A
bloody persecution sprung up against them in the
few years following, and four were put to death.
It was still later in the century, 1692, that the horrible
proceedings against witchcraft took place in
Salem, where many were most unjustly hanged,
and many more tortured into confession of abominable
falsehoods. It is well to remember this when
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
we grow indignant over the persecution of the
Huguenots in France. Further north, in Acadie,
or Nova Scotia, and Canada, the French had already
explored the St. Lawrence and the great lakes,
made some feeble settlements, and converted some
of the Indians. Their missionaries and adventurers
were full of heroism and zeal. Later in the century
they discovered the Mississippi, and claimed
all the territory in that Western region from its
source to its mouth, calling it, after the great king,
Louisiana.</p>
<p>In England, 1650 saw Oliver Cromwell in pretty
complete possession of power, Charles I having
been beheaded the year before. In 1651 the royal
army was totally defeated at Worcester, and Charles
II soon after escaped in disguise to France to come
back triumphantly in 1660, when the Lord Protector
had passed away. During the Commonwealth
Roman Catholics were deprived of the privilege
of voting or holding office, and the use of the
Prayer-book was forbidden to Episcopalians. It
was in the short reign of James II (1685-88) that
Judge Jeffreys wrote his name with letters of blood
in the annals of English history. When the people
turned to William of Orange, the perfidious and
tyrannical James was forced to flee with his family
to France, and spent the remainder of his days at
St. Germain, a pensioner on the bounty of Louis
XIV. Anne, the younger daughter of James II,
reigned over England from 1701 to 1714.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>On the continent of Europe the terrible Thirty
Years&rsquo; War (1618-1648) between Protestants and
Catholics, memorable for the brave deeds of Gustavus
Adolphus, had just closed in the Peace of
Westphalia, by which Brandenburg&mdash;the forerunner
of Prussia&mdash;was enlarged, and Saxony strengthened,
while Switzerland and the low countries, or
Netherlands, were acknowledged as independent
States. The Belgic Provinces, between the Netherlands
and France, divided among themselves, remained
submissive to Spain and the Roman Catholic
Church. They became involved in the wars attending
the decline of the Spanish monarchy, and
during the remainder of the century were the theater
of fierce struggles between contending armies, and
were subjected to many changes of boundaries.</p>
<p>Central Europe, where were the States of Bohemia,
Bavaria, Moravia, Austria, and smaller principalities,
was loosely confederated into the German
Empire under the Imperial Diet at Frankfort.
Ferdinand III at this time held the imperial dignity.
His death was followed by the long reign of
Leopold I (1657-1705). He attacked the Turks
on the East and the French monarch on the West.
From the former he obtained a great stretch of
territory, and in the combination which kept down
the towering ambition of the latter he was one of
the chief factors. In the North was the strong
kingdom of Sweden&mdash;soon to be made still stronger
by the victories of Charles X&mdash;and the weak kingdom
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
of Denmark. On the East were Poland and
Russia and the Turk. On the South were Spain,
Portugal, and Italy. Portugal, after a most honorable
history had been annexed by Philip II to
the Spanish realm; but in 1640, after a forced union
of one hundred and sixty years, it was freed by a
bold and successful conspiracy of the nobles, from
all connection with Spain, although its independence
was not formally recognized till 1668. Spain had
wholly lost her former headship in European politics
and was in a bad way under the last rulers of
the Hapsburg dynasty, bigoted, intolerant, incompetent;
disordered finances, impaired industries&mdash;due
largely to the barbarous expulsion of the Moors&mdash;and
inferior military forces left her in the second
rank of powers.</p>
<p>Italy was a mere geographical expression, the
territory being split up under the rule of petty
princes largely swayed by foreign influence; much
of the country indeed was under direct foreign dominion.
Among the native rulers the Dukes of
Savoy were perhaps the most enterprising and successful.
Venice maintained a fair degree of prosperity.
Naples was an appanage of the Spanish
crown. The popes had larger territorial possessions,
in the center of the country, than at any previous
or subsequent time. But this local importance
was more than offset by loss in the larger
sphere of influence and prerogative. Convenience,
indeed, occasionally led a prominent sovereign to
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
submit some question to the papal judgment;
in many instances his wishes were openly disregarded,
and in the leading questions of European
politics no deference was paid him.</p>
<p>An interesting episode occurring just at this
time perhaps deserves mention. Queen Christina
of Sweden, the talented but eccentric daughter of
the great Gustavus Adolphus, in 1654 abdicated her
throne in favor of her cousin, quitted the land of
her fathers, was solemnly admitted into the Roman
Catholic Church at Innspruck, and established her
permanent residence in Rome till her death in 1689.
The pope, Alexander VII, considered it the special
distinction of his pontificate that he was permitted
to welcome so distinguished a convert; but she did
not prove in all things wholly satisfactory, not finding
matters quite as she expected&mdash;a frequent experience
in such cases. To Gilbert Burnet, the English
Bishop of Salisbury, who paid her a visit, she
said, &ldquo;It was certain that the Church was governed
by the immediate care of God, for none of the four
popes that she had known since she came to Rome
had common sense.&rdquo; She called them &ldquo;the first and
the last of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of France during the period in
which F&eacute;nelon flourished must be given at somewhat
greater length if we would properly comprehend
the part which he took on the stage of action.
And especially must we attend to the character of
Louis XIV, with whom F&eacute;nelon was brought into
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
such exceeding close and fateful relations. Louis
came to the throne in 1643, but as he was then only
five years old he did not assume personal charge
of the government. Cardinal Mazarin, who had
succeeded the great Richelieu at his death in 1642,
was chief minister in the Council of State which
advised the Queen Mother and regent, Anne of
Austria. On the death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis
took supreme direction of affairs, and retained it
until his death in 1715. It was a very long and, in
some respects, a very successful reign, the most
illustrious in French annals; a sort of Solomonic
era, to be compared with the age of Pericles in
Greece, Augustus in Rome, and Elizabeth in England.
It was brilliant in many directions; an age
of conquest and the extension of territory abroad;
an age of great personalities in literature and art
at home. Among the latter are the well-known
names of Corneille, the tragic poet; Moliere, the
master of comedy; Racine, La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld,
La Bruyere, Pascal, Malebranche, and
Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;. Voltaire and Rousseau were
born during this reign, but mainly flourished later.
Among eminent painters were Poussin, Claude Lorrain,
Lebrun, and Mignard. As architects, Mansart
and Perrault were famous; among sculptors,
Piget; among composers, Lulli. Celebrated in the
pulpit were Bossuet, Bourdaloue, Massillon, and
Flechier; as Church historians, Natalis Alexander,
Fleury, and Tillemont. In the field the prestige of
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
the French armies was upheld by the genius of
Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Vauban, Luxemburg, and Catinat.
Under these marshals many victories were
won in an almost constant succession of wars with
Spain, Holland, England, the Empire, and other antagonists.
The peace which Louis dictated to
Europe at Nimeguen, February 5, 1679, raised him
to his highest point of power and glory. The headship
of the world seemed to be within his grasp,
if indeed it was not already attained. His courtiers
worshiped him as a demigod; two triumphal
arches were erected to his honor in Paris; foreign
governments regarded him with keen apprehension
or with servile awe. He excited wonder and fear
throughout the continent, for his ambitious projects
of still vaster dominion seemed to threaten
the safety and independence of all his neighbors.
He was possessed of a strong mind, a resolute will,
considerable sagacity and penetration, much aptitude
for business, and an indefatigable industry.
His powers of application were remarkable. When
he gave direction in 1661 that he would be his own
prime minister, that all business should pass through
his hands, and all questions be decided directly by
himself, every one expected that he would soon
tire of the drudgery which this would impose; but
he kept it up till the end of his life, laboring regularly
in his cabinet eight hours a day. He had the
most extravagant ideas of the royal prerogative. He
was an absolute, irresponsible monarch, accustomed
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
to say and mean, &ldquo;The State: it is myself.&rdquo; Even
the property of the realm he considered as his. In
an instruction to his son he declared, &ldquo;Kings are
absolute lords and have naturally the full and free
disposal of all the goods possessed, as well by
Churchmen as by laymen, to use them at all times
according to the general need of their State.&rdquo; Having
this conception of his power, regarding his authority
as delegated immediately from heaven, he
surrounded himself with those who would be subservient
to his will, and the one avenue of advancement
was his favor; without this, virtue and merit
had little or no chance of recognition. He made his
court at Versailles a very splendid one, everywhere
praised and admired as the model of taste and refinement.
It became the center of fashion for
Europe, and the only place of high attraction in
the kingdom. Henri Martin, in his &ldquo;History of
France,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Whoever had once tasted this
life so brilliant, so animated, so varied, could no
longer quit it and return to his native manor without
dying of languor and ennui. Everything
seemed cold and dead away from this place of enjoyment,
which appeared, to town and province, as
the very ideal of human life.&rdquo; It is estimated that
a sum, equal to more than 400,000,000 francs at the
present rate, was laid out on the palaces and pleasure-grounds
of Versailles, transforming an unsightly
district into fairy-land.</p>
<p>Was this Louis XIV, then, a really great man?
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Not when tried by tests that go far and reach
deep. As one has said: &ldquo;His claim to renown lies
more in the diligent and tireless ambition with
which he improved favoring circumstances than in
the creation of great results out of small means by
force of personal genius and energy. It is also a
limiting factor in our estimate of Louis that he exercised
no care to husband the resources of his
country, and sacrificed to thirst for personal display
the chances of future prosperity. This imposing
and brilliant reign left France exhausted and
harboring within herself the germs of violent revolution.&rdquo;
In the latter part of his reign the coalition
against him under Marlborough and Prince Eugene
proved eminently successful, and much of his ill-gotten
acquisitions had to be disgorged. Moreover,
his reign was also a failure in that, for the sake of
slight and temporary gains on the continent of
Europe, he threw away the opportunity to forestall
in Asia and America the progress of England, so
soon to pass France in the race for world supremacy,
and left his kingdom, at the close of his reign, exhausted
and crippled, in no condition to enter upon
the decisive stage of the great conflict whose approach
he did not foresee. Before his burial the
eyes of Frenchmen had begun to be open to the
shadowy side of his reign; the glamour and the
glory could no longer hide the tyranny and the
shame, and very few mourned at the death of the
magnificent despot. He was far from great also in
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
his private life; for that was, for a long time, one
of unblushing licentiousness. Different mistresses
were made successively, and in part simultaneously,
the rivals of his dishonored queen, Maria Theresa
of Spain, who died in 1683. No less than ten children
were born to him out of wedlock, and publicly
acknowledged. After the death of his queen
he did somewhat better, being privately married to
Madame de Maintenon, as already noted.</p>
<p>The cruel persecutions of the Huguenots must
also be set down against the king, although in this,
surely, we should make much allowance because of
the feeling of the age in such matters&mdash;a feeling not
by any means the same as in our day. Louis, like
many others before and since, endeavored to atone
for the excesses and frailties of his private life by
his public zeal for orthodoxy, fancying that the
slaughter of heretics would offset his adulteries.
His crowning crime was the revocation of the Edict
of Nantes. By this arbitrary act of unprovoked
despotism he annulled forever all the highly prized
privileges granted to the Huguenots, after their
large sufferings and heroic efforts in self-defense,
by Henry IV and Louis XIII. He absolutely prohibited
the exercise of their religion throughout the
kingdom, with the sole exception of Alsace; ordered
their temples to be leveled with the ground, and
their ministers to quit France within fifteen days;
forbade the people to follow their pastors into
exile under pain of confiscation and condemnation
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
to the galleys; and required their children to be
baptized henceforth by the Catholic priests and
educated as members of the Established Church.
Before this, in the earlier years of the reign, stringent
measures had been set in operation for the conversion
of the Protestants and the establishment of
uniformity of faith and Church government
throughout the kingdom. Louis was intolerant of
dissent, partly from political motives. He could
not brook that any of his subjects should exercise
so much independence and freedom of thought as
was involved in worshiping God or thinking about
Him after a different pattern from the one set by
himself. They ought all to take their opinions from
the throne, he held, in religious as well as in secular
matters, and because they did not they were extremely
objectionable and dangerous. As early as
1656 a disposition was shown to interpret the Edict
of Nantes&mdash;given by Henry IV, April 15, 1598&mdash;in
a narrow partisan fashion, to the disadvantage
of the Protestants. Numbers of the Reformed
places of worship were shut up on frivolous pretenses.
The worshipers were excluded from all
public functions, from the liberal professions, from
the universities, from engaging in various branches
of commerce and industry. They were forbidden
to intermarry with Catholics, and their children
were encouraged to forsake the faith of their parents
by being declared capable of choosing for themselves
at the age of seven years. Every sort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
pressure was applied. A Bureau of Conversions
was established under the direction of the Minister
Pelissier, who disbursed the funds intrusted to him
at the rate of six livres for every abjuration of the
Reformed religion. Milder measures not proving
sufficiently efficacious and speedy, more severe and
savage means were employed. Dragoons were sent
into the disturbed districts and quartered on the inhabitants;
they were permitted, and even encouraged,
to abandon themselves to every kind of brutal
license, violence, and excess, establishing a veritable
reign of terror wherever they appeared. It is
no wonder that, under these horrors, wearied and
worried well-nigh to death by such intolerable impositions,
great numbers of Huguenots recanted,
nominally, although, of course, their real beliefs
were not changed. And when the protecting Edict
was formally revoked, still more fearful cruelties
followed. Multitudes of the Reformed, obstinately
refusing obedience, were consigned to loathsome
dungeons, racked with exquisite tortures, and
treated with every kind of outrage short of actual
murder. Numbers of females were immured for
life in convents; infants were torn from the arms of
their mothers; their property was destroyed, and
whole districts were laid waste. How far the king
was strictly responsible for the whole of these horrors
is a matter of some question; but it is certain
that he received with great satisfaction the
chorus of congratulations, on this memorable Catholic
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
triumph, from the court sycophants, who hailed
him as the new Constantine, and who included in
their number such men as Bossuet, Massillon, Racine,
and La Fontaine. But Louis inflicted almost
as deadly a blow upon his country by these persecutions
as the rulers of Spain had upon theirs when
they drove out the Moors and Jews. France robbed
herself of her best citizens, the most enterprising
and industrious of her skilled artisans. They fled
abroad to the number of at least a quarter of a
million, escaping from France to enrich England,
Holland, and other countries with the fruits of their
labors. Among them was the Duke of Schomberg,
one of the best generals of his time, who placed his
sword at the disposal of the Prince of Orange.
Many also who remained were so crippled and depressed
that they could no longer render their best
service. Moreover, a bitter and profound resentment
was kindled in the Protestant States of
Europe, which acted very unfavorably upon the
foreign relations of France, and strengthened the
hands of the coalition against her. So, in every
sense, the policy must be adjudged a mistaken one,
counting against the greatness of the king.</p>
<p>It is important to inquire what was the state of
the French Church at this period. It is impossible,
of course, for us to enter into extended details, but
we can hardly understand either F&eacute;nelon or his
times without knowing something about the ecclesiastical
religious questions which were then agitating
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
the public mind. Religion was by no means in
a stagnant state, or treated with indifference and
apathy; it everywhere excited keenest attention. No
subject was more eagerly discussed or occupied a
larger share of thought. Besides the general controversy
between Protestants and Romanists, there
were many divisions in the ranks of the latter.
There was fierce conflict between the Jesuits and
Jansenists, also between the Gallicans and Ultramontanists.
For a full recital of the story our
readers will be obliged to consult Church histories
and cyclopedias.</p>
<p>Of the Jesuits little need here be said; their history
is very well known. Established by Ignatius
Loyola in 1540, the system was, in the period we
are considering, something over a hundred years
old, and numbering about fifteen thousand members,
of whom half were priests. Its leading purposes
were the overthrow of Protestantism and the
strengthening of the papacy. It had a magnificent
organization, it largely controlled the education of
the youth of the better classes of society, and it
was intensely zealous in missionary operations,
Francis Xavier, so illustrious in this matter, being
one of its original founders. In politics it often
favored popular rights, especially if it would benefit
the papacy by reducing the power of the sovereign;
yet it usually secured control over the princes
by obtaining their ear in the confessional. In doctrine
it was opposed to Augustinianism, and in
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
ethics became notorious for most dangerous looseness.
It should not be forgotten, however, that the
order had at all times many members eminent for
piety and strict morality, some of the highest saints
being numbered with them. In France the important
office of confessor to the king was filled by
members of this order under Henry IV, Louis XIII,
XIV, XV; and, of course, in this way an enormous
influence was exercised upon the royal policy at
home and abroad. The connivance of these confessors
with the scandalous lives of the kings did
more than anything else to undermine respect for
the Roman Catholic Church and for religion in general
among the educated classes. Between the
Jesuits and Jansenists there was fierce war.</p>
<p>The latter took their name from Bishop Cornelius
Jansen, of Ypern, who died in 1638, after devoting
his whole life to the study of the works of
St. Augustine. His followers were Augustinians
in the fullest sense of the term, accepting the extreme
doctrines of election and predestination which
are known among Protestants as Calvinism; but
this in no way predisposed them to favor the
Huguenots. On the contrary they seemed to hate
them all the more because of this manifest approach
to them in some of their principles, partly because
it exposed them to a galling criticism from the
Jesuits. The Jansenists in many ways recommend
themselves to our approval. They opposed a simply
formal righteousness, insisted on the necessity
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
for an inward preparation to receive benefits from
the sacraments, and laid stress upon the reading of
the Scriptures. In regard to morals, they advocated
rigid self-discipline, were foes of luxury, the theater,
and other doubtful or noxious pleasures. They
also had more independence than most classes of
society. They were not ready to surrender everything
to the absolute sovereignty of the king; they
stood for liberty in the Church. In point of ability
and culture they furnished some of the best minds
of France, and some of the best models of literary
excellence which the age could boast. Blaise Pascal,
whose &ldquo;Provincial Letters&rdquo; (1656) against the
Jesuits inflicted upon them so severe a blow by
their scathing exposures, was of this party. So was
De Sacy, who translated the Bible into the version
in general use; and Antoine Arnauld, the celebrated
scholar and Doctor of the Sorbonne, the theological
department of the University of Paris. His sister,
Jacqueline, became abbess of the convent of Port
Royal near Paris, and made it renowned for its
purity and piety. Jansenism or &ldquo;Calvinistic Catholicism,&rdquo;
as it has been called, finally went down
before its enemies, the popes deciding against it
more than once. On many accounts it deserved a
better fate; but we can not regret that such a
travesty of Christianity as the sole salvation of an
arbitrarily limited and eternally selected few was
as conclusively defeated in the Roman Catholic
Church as it has since been in the Protestant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The Jesuits were Ultramontanes; that is, they
did everything they could to strengthen the authority
from beyond the mountains, residing in the city
on the Tiber. The Jansenists favored Gallicanism.
A few words are necessary about this latter, for it
had a large place in the discussions of the time,
and echoes of it have continued to our day, the long
conflict coming to an end in the recent rupture of
the Concordat between France and the Vatican.
The quarrel is of very long standing. It is historically
certain that at a very early period the
National Church of France had a character of freedom
peculiar to itself. The Frankish Church in the
time of Charlemagne gave evidence of a spirit and
temper obviously different from the Italian ideal of
the Church as organized under the popes. The
French Parliaments from time to time manfully resisted
encroachments on their powers or those of
their kings, from beyond the mountains. As early
as 1269, Louis IX of France issued an edict&mdash;so it
is alleged&mdash;called the Pragmatic Sanction, in which
he strove to protect the freedom of Church elections
and the rights of patrons from the interference of
the popes, and forbade papal taxation without the
consent of the monarch. This conflict went on
through the centuries with various incidents and
differing results, which need not here be followed,
although it is a very interesting story. In the time
of Louis XIV matters naturally came to a head
through the determination of that monarch to extend
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
his absolute authority over the Church as well
as the State, and through the support which he received
from the strong feeling of nationality which
dominated the French people during his reign,
Louis&rsquo;s aim was to exercise such power in ecclesiastical
matters in France as Henry VIII had taken
to himself in England, but not to effect a complete
rupture with Rome. In particular he determined
to enforce the right of the crown to the revenue
and the patronage connected with vacant sees, which
had long been exercised over a large part of the
realm; he insisted on extending it to all the provinces.
An assembly of the clergy was called in
1682, under the lead of Bossuet, the chief champion
of the king in these matters. Four important
articles formulating the opposition of France to
the high claims of the papacy were drawn up by
Bossuet, subscribed to by this assembly, and confirmed
by the civil authorities. They contained in
substance the following specifications: (1) The
pope&rsquo;s authority, as also that of the Church in general,
is confined to things spiritual. He has no
prerogative to depose kings and princes or to release
their subjects from allegiance. (2) The decrees
promulgated at Constance respecting the authority
of Ecumenical Councils subsist in full force.
(3) In the use of his power the pope must respect
the ecclesiastical canons, as also such constitutions
as are received in the kingdom and Church of
France. (4) While the pope has the principal voice
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
in matters of faith, his judgment is subject to
amendment until it has been approved by the
Church.</p>
<p>Bossuet, the leading spirit of this assembly, and
indeed the most powerful and commanding Churchman
of his day, esteemed the boasted infallibility of
the pope a baseless fiction. He allowed that indefectibility
belongs to the chair of Peter in the
sense that heresy can not find there any continuous
and stubborn support. But this, he maintained, in
no wise precluded a temporary aberration of the
individual pontiff or the competency of the universal
Church to administer correction to the pontiff. Such
principles had been at home in France ever since the
era of the great Reform Councils of the fifteenth
century. The pope&mdash;Innocent XI was then in the
chair&mdash;was highly incensed, and refused confirmation
to those members of the assembly of 1682
whom the king nominated to episcopal sees. Affairs
remained in a very unsettled condition for a
considerable interval, no mode of accommodation
being reached, each party standing its ground; but
in 1691 the French Church found itself with thirty-five
bishoprics vacant, and the king allowed the
twelve signers of the declaration whom he had nominated
as bishops, but whom the pope had thus far
refused to recognize as such, to retract all that had
displeased the pontiff. The pope also gained some
advantage from the bitter partisan conflicts within
the Gallican Church during the closing years of
Louis XIV.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>As to the amount of spiritual life in the Church
during these years it is not so easy to acquire reliable
information as it is concerning the more outward
events. But there are many indications that
it was very considerable, that the Roman Catholic
Church at that period was in a very much better
state than it is at present. There was an evident
desire among a large number of its clergy to rid
it of its gross superstitions. They opposed some of
its absurdities, omitted many of its ridiculous ceremonies,
endeavored to render Catholicism more rational
and intelligent, more Scriptural and pious.
There are tokens that France had then a very large
number of true followers of the Savior; some in
elevated stations whose virtues shine afar, but many
more in obscure positions, God&rsquo;s hidden ones,
known only to Him and to those immediately
around them. Among the more prominent of the
writers on spiritual subjects flourishing at this time
in France may be mentioned Antoinette Bourignon
(died 1680), whose published works amount to
twenty-five volumes: one of her hymns, &ldquo;Come,
Savior, Jesus, from above,&rdquo; translated by John Wesley,
is in our Hymnal, No. 379. Peter Poiret (died
in 1719), court preacher of the Palatine, was an
admirer of Madame Bourignon, whose works he
published; he also brought out the works of Madame
Guyon in thirty-nine volumes; he was both a philosopher
and a deeply pious man. The Baron de
Renty (1611-1649) was a man of the profoundest
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
spirituality, greatly admired by Wesley, who spoke
of him in the highest terms, and published his life.
Alphonsus de Sarasa (died in 1666) gave to the
world &ldquo;The Art of Always Rejoicing,&rdquo; a beautiful
book, filled with the deepest Christian philosophy.
The Abb&eacute; Guillor&eacute;, also a contemporary of F&eacute;nelon
and belonging to the same school of piety, left
to the world as his monument a treatise on &ldquo;Self-Renunciation,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Art of Dying to Self and
Living for the Love of Jesus.&rdquo; And Nicholas Herman,
better known as Brother Lawrence, admitted,
in 1666, as a lay brother among the barefooted Carmelites
at Paris, is still known in the realm of pure
and undefiled religion by his letters on &ldquo;The Practice
of the Presence of God,&rdquo; published at the instance
of the Cardinal de Noailles. St. Vincent de
Paul (died 1660), to mention but one more of these
illustrious names, founder of the order of Sisters
of Charity, was a philanthropist of the first rank.
Neglected children, condemned criminals, prisoners
of the cell and the galley, all classes of the poor and
the unfortunate, received from him a sympathy as
practical as it was warm and persevering. Consecrated
activity he regarded as the essence of religion.
The spirit of his life is well expressed in his
own words: &ldquo;The genuine mark of loving God is
a good and perfect action. It is only our works
which accompany us into the other life.&rdquo; From all
this it is seen that the age and land which produced
F&eacute;nelon had many other sons and daughters of very
similar excellence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br />PRECEPTOR TO THE PRINCE.</h2>
<p>Louis XIV, being bent upon the subjection of
the Huguenots, and knowing full well that violence
alone could accomplish the matter only in part, cast
about in his mind for a suitable person to undertake
the milder r&ocirc;le of persuasion. F&eacute;nelon had
already attracted notice both by his good work at
the community of New Catholics and also by the
treatise which he had written in defense of the
Apostolic Succession. So when Bossuet suggested
him as a suitable commissioner for the districts of
Poitou and Saintonge, in the West, not far from
the Protestant stronghold of La Rochelle, districts
where great confusion and irritation prevailed, and
where only a tender, judicious hand could hope to
guide matters, the king very gladly made the appointment.
F&eacute;nelon, before accepting it, made two
stipulations. One was that he should be allowed
to choose his fellow-workers. He selected the Abb&eacute;
de Langeron, his lifelong friend, the Abb&eacute; Fleury,
the well-known historian, the Abb&eacute; Bertier, and
the Abb&eacute; Milon, who later on became respectively
Bishops of Blois and of Condom. The other stipulation
was that the troops, together with all that
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
savored of military terrorism, should be withdrawn
before he entered on what should be solely a work
of peace and mercy. There had been terrible doings
and violent outrages with which F&eacute;nelon
could have no sympathy. There is no doubt whatever
upon this point. His own words are abundantly
on record. Although the country was so disturbed,
he positively refused a military escort; and
when the king represented the danger he might be
exposed to, he answered: &ldquo;Sire, ought a missionary
to fear danger? If you hope for an apostolical
harvest, we must go in the true character of apostles.
I would rather perish by the hands of my
mistaken brethren than see one of them exposed
to the inevitable violence of the military.&rdquo; In a letter
to a duke he says, &ldquo;The work of God is not effected
in the heart by force; that is not the true
spirit of the Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the extremely difficult task of showing
to Protestants whose property had been pillaged,
whose families had been scattered, whose blood had
been shed like water, the truth and excellence of
the religion of their persecutors. That this could be
done to any very extensive degree might well be
questioned. But the missionaries were characterized
by ability, mildness, prudence, benevolence, and
sound judgment, and they did all that any reasonable
persons could expect. The people of these
provinces were amazed to see men of high birth and
position leaving the court and capital to come
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
among them. They supposed that, at all events,
such men would be luxurious and haughty, as they
had been told; but when, on the contrary, they saw
the missionaries nothing but lowly, self-denying,
simple-mannered priests, whose real aims seemed
to be the temporal as well as spiritual advantage of
those among whom they lived, prejudice began to
melt away. In February, 1686&mdash;the mission began
in December, 1685, and lasted till July, 1686, being
renewed for a few months in the next year, May
to July, 1687&mdash;F&eacute;nelon wrote to the Marquis de
Seignelai, Secretary of State, and brother to the
Duchess de Beauvilliers: &ldquo;In the present condition
of men&rsquo;s minds we could easily bring them all to
confession and communion if we chose to use a little
pressure and so glorify our mission. But what is
the good of bringing men to confession who do not
yet recognize the Church? How can we give Jesus
Christ to those who do not believe they are receiving
Him? We should expect to bring a terrible
curse upon us if we were satisfied with hasty, superficial
work, all meant for show. We can but multiply
our instructions, invite the people to come
heartily to sacraments, but give them only to those
who come of their own accord to seek them in unreserved
submission. I must not forget to add that
we want a great quantity of books, especially New
Testaments.&rdquo; Again he writes later: &ldquo;The corn
you have sent so cheaply proves to the people that
our charity is practical. It is the most persuasive
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
kind of controversy. It amazes them, for they see
the exact reverse of all their ministers have taught
them as incontrovertibly true. We need preachers
to explain the Gospel every Sunday with a loving,
winning authority; people brought up in dissent
are only to be won by the words spoken to them.
We must give New Testaments profusely everywhere,
but they must be in large type; the people
can not read small print. We can not expect them
to buy Catholic books. It is a great thing if they
will read what costs them nothing; indeed the
greater proportion can not afford to buy.&rdquo; He
wrote also to Bossuet in March, 1686, &ldquo;Our converts
get on, but very slowly; it is no trifling matter
to change the opinions of a whole people.&rdquo; It
is very evident that F&eacute;nelon had the most sincere
desire for the conversion of the Protestants, believing,
of course, as he did, from the bottom of his
heart, that they were destined to eternal woe.
Brought up in the atmosphere in which he was, he
could not possibly sympathize with their position,
could not regard their heroism as other than obstinacy.
But such was the natural mildness of his
disposition and his acquaintance with the demands
of genuine religion, that he could in no way be content
with a merely nominal acquiescence or consent,
and with the use of that force by which such
acquiescence was obtained.</p>
<p>His mission to Saintonge has been called a dark
page in his life. Yet the strongly prejudiced writer
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
who so characterizes it says in the same connection,
after referring to F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s firm stand against violence
and the forcing of conscience: &ldquo;To us this
measure of clemency seems bare and scanty enough;
in F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s own time it was both unusual and effective.
His counsels of mercy had weight with the
minister, and led to the suppression of various
abuses, civil as well as ecclesiastical. They manifestly
gained for him the affection of his proselytes,
and, stirring up against him the bile of the more
rigid Catholics, seem to have stood in the way of
his promotion to the bishopric.&rdquo; It was a little after
this that he was appointed to the See of Poitiers,
which was the chief city of Poitou, but De Harlai,
who by this time was anything but a friend, succeeded
in getting it immediately revoked; and the
next year the archbishop was again successful in
his unworthy maneuvers. The Bishop of Rochelle
had been greatly impressed by the zeal and gentle
wisdom of the young missioner, and he now came
to Paris, without giving F&eacute;nelon any hint of his intention,
to ask the king to appoint him as Coadjutor
Bishop of Rochelle. It would have been done but
for the insinuations of De Harlai that the attraction
between the two men was a mutual leaning to Jansenism,
and as this was always a sore point with
Louis, he at once refused to make the appointment.
F&eacute;nelon might easily have refuted these assertions&mdash;for
there was not a word of truth in them, as his
close friendship with Bossuet, Tronson, and others,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
showed&mdash;but he did not take the trouble so to do.
He was not ambitious of dignities.</p>
<p>Was his mission to Saintonge and Poitou a
dark page in his history? We can hardly look upon
it in this light. It seems to us that he comes out
of it with considerable credit. Can we take it amiss
in him that he was a stanch adherent of the Roman
Catholic Church, not only at this time, but throughout
all his life? Not if we are reasonable, and do
not demand miracles where there is no occasion for
expecting them. Shall we withhold our admiration
from those who do not rise entirely superior to all
their surroundings, and see things as we, in totally
different conditions, see them? In that case, dealt
with after so harsh a judgment, we ourselves might
come off badly, and we should most certainly have
to bar out from our favor a very large proportion
of the men who have done the most for the world&rsquo;s
advancement.</p>
<p>It was about this same time that Sir Matthew
Hale in England (he died in 1676)&mdash;who was reckoned
the best judge of his time, acute, learned, sensible,
setting himself strongly against bribery, one
of the serious vices of his age, a friend of Richard
Baxter, an austere scholar, leaning to the side of
the Puritans&mdash;sentenced women to be executed for
witchcraft, and sent John Bunyan to jail for frequenting
conventicles, politely dismissing, without
redress, his wife, who pleaded for his discharge.
And in our own time we have seen the Earl of
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
Shaftesbury, who did such wonderful things for
the oppressed in some directions, most bitter against
the reformers in all other lines except his own, the
stanchest of Tories, and the most rigid of Churchmen,
denouncing the democratic principle as anti-Christian,
and upholding the infamous Conventicle
Act, which forbade worship in a private house by
more than twenty persons. Similar inconsistencies
can be pointed out in the record of nearly all good
men. What does it prove? Simply that it is given
to very few to rise much above the age in which
they live, or to be at all points independent of the
impress placed upon them in their early years. We
see no reason to believe that F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s attitude
toward the Protestants of his day was other than
an entirely sincere and conscientious one, such as
might be fairly looked for in a person of his surroundings.</p>
<p>It is possible to impute sinister and selfish motives
to any, if one is so disposed, but we see no
benefit from this policy. It is not the way we would
wish to be treated ourselves. Almost every act of a
man&rsquo;s life is susceptible of an evil construction, if
sufficient pains is taken and sufficient force applied.
But we can not join with those who appear to delight
in pulling down from their pedestals all that
have been lifted above their fellows in goodness by
the general suffrage of mankind. Truth, of course,
is to be sought at all costs. But it makes a vast
difference from what standpoint the facts are approached,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
whether with suspicion and aversion, or
cordial appreciation and comprehension. There is
often an underlying dislike to a certain type of
character or to certain sentiments and opinions, because
of the wide difference between them and those
which the writer himself holds and practices, which
makes it impossible that he should see them in an
unbiased light. We can not escape the conclusion
that F&eacute;nelon has been treated by some recent writers
in this manner, and we protest against its unfairness.</p>
<p>It may be truthfully said that F&eacute;nelon, while
doing faithfully what appeared to him the duty of
the hour on this mission, did not particularly enjoy
it. He had no love for life in the country or for the
work in which he was engaged. He longed for
the quiet of his former post, with its larger opportunities
for study and reflection, and for the time
when he should be free to return to Paris. In a
letter to Bossuet he playfully threatens to bring suspicion
of heresy upon himself or &ldquo;incur a lucky disgrace&rdquo;
that might give him excuse for his recall.
He was permitted, shortly after this, to go back to
his place at the New Catholics, where for some two
years more he occupied himself in a quiet, inconspicuous
manner. Summing up the results of his
controversial work among the Huguenots, we are
disposed to conclude, with one of his biographers,
that &ldquo;if his moderation and humanity in an age in
which such qualities were not esteemed, were remembered
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
against him when other clouds were
gathering, and contributed to his ultimate ruin, they
add no less grace to the record of his life, and must
have deepened his influence with those whose eyes
were undimmed by prejudice and bigotry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most important period in the life of F&eacute;nelon
was now to begin; that for which the earlier
years were but a preparation; that which would
color and dominate all his succeeding days. The
time had come when the little grandson of the king,
the Duke of Burgundy, the hope of France (for his
father, the dauphin, was a failure, wholly incompetent
to fill any large place), should pass from the
hands of nurses to masculine rule. What could be
of greater importance, considering how much was at
stake for the kingdom, than the proper selection
of those who should take this weighty charge?
When the dauphin had been at a similar stage of
his education he was committed to the care of the
Duke de Montausier and Bossuet as the greatest
and most celebrated men of their day. But though
they did their best, the course they took was not in
all respects well advised, and the results, at least,
had not been satisfactory. This would make the
utmost care now all the more imperative. Happily
the king was fully alive to his responsibility, and,
in addition to his own penetration, had the benefit
of good counsel in the matter. Madame de Maintenon
was now a power at court, and was using
her influence in the best directions. She was a warm
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
friend of the Duke de Beauvilliers, who also stood
high in the good graces of Louis; for the monarch,
in spite of his own serious lapses from virtue, admired
it in others, and knew its importance with
the young. The duke was accordingly made governor
of the royal grandchildren, Burgundy and
his two younger brothers, with unlimited power of
nominating all the other officers about them and
all the inferior attendants. He had no hesitation as
to the best preceptor France could produce for the
little prince, and immediately named F&eacute;nelon, a
choice which was loudly applauded by the public
throughout the kingdom. The people said that
Louis the Great had once more outshone all earlier
monarchs, and shown himself wiser than Phillip of
Macedon when he appointed Aristotle tutor to his
son. Bossuet was overjoyed at the good fortune of
Church and State, and regretted only that the Marquis
de F&eacute;nelon had not lived to see an elevation of
the merit which hid itself with so much care. It
was a great surprise to the recipient, who was leading
his ordinary retired life, neither seeking nor expecting
court favor. It was a great gratification to
his friends, who poured in lavish congratulations.
But M. Tronson, the wise old tutor from St. Sulpice,
wrote that his joy was mixed with fear, considering
the perils to which his favorite pupil would
now be exposed. He says: &ldquo;It opens the door to
earthly greatness, but you must fear lest it should
close that of the real greatness of heaven. You are
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
thrown into a region where the Gospel of Jesus
Christ is little known, and where even those who
know it use their knowledge chiefly as a means to
win human respect. If ever the study and meditation
of Holy Scripture were necessary to you, now
indeed they have become overwhelmingly indispensable.
Above all, it is of infinite importance that
you never lose sight of the final hour of death, when
all this world&rsquo;s glory will fade away like a dream,
and every earthly stay on which you may have
leaned must fail.&rdquo; This counsel was most creditable
to both tutor and pupil, showing a love stronger
than ordinary friendship. The post which seemed
so dazzling and so promising did indeed prove one
of much danger as well as glory, but not exactly
in the way that the aged teacher anticipated.</p>
<p>The Duke of Burgundy, now seven years old,
was, in the most emphatic sense, an <i>enfant terrible</i>.
He was very different from his heavy, stupid
father, inheriting some of his qualities, it is said,
from his mother, Mary Anne of Bavaria, a delicate,
melancholy, unattractive princess, passionate, proud,
and caustic. Burgundy was a frail, unhealthy creature,
whose body lacked symmetry as well as his
mind. One shoulder very early outgrew the other,
defying the most cruel efforts of the surgeons to
set it right, and doing serious mischief to his general
health. His nervous system was much deranged,
so that he was subject to hurricanes of passion.
The least contradiction made him furious.
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
He would fall into ungovernable fits of rage even
against inanimate objects. He had an insatiable appetite
for all sorts of pleasure. His pride and arrogance
were indescribable. Mankind he looked
upon as atoms with whom he had nothing in common;
his brothers were only intermediate beings between
him and the human race. He had a quick,
penetrating mind, and a marvelous memory. He
was stiff against threats, on his guard against flattery,
amenable only to reason; but by no means always
to that. Often when it reasserted itself, after
one of his tornadoes, he was so much ashamed of
himself that he fell into a new fit of rage. He
was, however, frank and truthful in the extreme.</p>
<p>Such was the prince who&mdash;with his brothers, the
Duke of Anjou, afterwards Philip V of Spain, and
the Duke of Berri&mdash;was committed entirely to the
care of F&eacute;nelon. When he accepted his new appointment
he abandoned all other offices and occupations,
permitting himself no distractions even of
friendship, that he might concentrate all his powers
of insight and reflection upon his charges. Now,
indeed, his studies of education would be fully
tested, and on the most conspicuous conceivable
field his theories must be reduced to practice. It
is said that &ldquo;he pursued only one system, which
was to have none.&rdquo; In other words, he devoted his
fertile mind to meeting the necessities of the hour
as they arose in his volatile, chameleon-like pupil,
instead of subjecting him to a Procrustean system
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
which could only have had the worst outcome. His
facile pen was employed without stint in the service
of his pupil. Many fables, some in French, some in
Latin, full of poetry and grace, were written to
convey special lessons to the little duke. &ldquo;Dialogues
of the Dead&rdquo; also were composed for the same purpose,
bringing in the principal personages of antiquity
to converse on such themes as would instruct
in regard to history and morals. And all this
was but a preparation for &ldquo;Telemaque,&rdquo; or Telemachus,
composed for the instruction of the heir
to the throne, and endowed with such unfailing
charm by the beauty of its style and the admirable
nature of its sentences, that it has been read ever
since in many nations and by many classes. The
same mythology is employed in it that was used by
Homer and Virgil, but refined by the knowledge of
the Divine revelation and adorned by a tincture of
Christianity that runs easily through the whole narrative.
The best classical and moral maxims are
placed before the mind of the reader, animated with
love and heightened with action. The author shows
that the glory of a prince is to govern men in such
a way as to make them good and happy; that his
authority is never so firmly established as in the love
of his people; that the true riches and prosperity of
a State consists in taking away what ministers to
general luxury, and in being content with innocent
and simple pleasures.</p>
<p>But, as may well be supposed, it was not the intellectual
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
means alone&mdash;the text-books that were
prepared, the treatises that were written, the pains
taken with instruction&mdash;which most awaken our admiration,
but rather the good sense shown in the
various special expedients that were employed as
from time to time they were found adapted to the
needs of the case. Every effort was made to relieve
study from tedium. Lessons were abandoned
whenever the prince wished to begin a conversation
from which he might derive useful information.
There were frequent intervals for exercise.
Learning was turned into a pleasure. The real
struggle was with his fiery temperament, which had
been hitherto so badly mismanaged, and which could
only be met by patience and gentleness with firmness.
When one of the evil moods seized him, it
was an understood thing in the household that every
one should relapse into an unwonted silence. Nobody
spoke to him if they could help it; his attendants
waited upon him with averted eyes as though
reluctant to witness his degradation through passion.
He was treated with the sort of humiliating
compassion which might be shown to a madman;
his books and appliances for study were put aside
as useless to one in such a state, and he was left
to his own reflections. Such a course was the destruction
of self-complacency; he ceased to find relief
in swearing when his hearers ceased to be disconcerted
by his abuse, and, being left to consider
the situation in solitude, he saw himself for the first
time as others saw him. Gradually this treatment
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
would bring the passionate but generous child to a
better mind, and then, full of remorse and penitence,
he would come to throw himself with the fullest affection
and trust upon the never-failing patience
and goodness of the preceptor, whom he almost
worshiped to his dying day.</p>
<p>F&eacute;nelon had studied childhood, and knew how
deeply rooted is the child&rsquo;s fear of ridicule; in the
prince it was exaggerated by his abnormal vanity,
and a system which showed him how he degraded
himself, and lost all shadow of dignity when he lost
his self-control, was the surest to produce a radical
reform. There are still in existence two pledges of
his childish repentance, testifying to the difficulty
with which his faults were conquered. &ldquo;I promise,
on my word as a prince to M. l&rsquo;Abb&eacute; de F&eacute;nelon,
that I will do at once whatever he bids me, and
will obey him instantly in what he forbids; and if
I break my word I will accept any kind of punishment
and disgrace. Given at Versailles, November
29, 1689. Louis.&rdquo; This promise, in spite of the
word of a prince, was probably broken; for many
months later he enters on another engagement
pathetic in its brevity: &ldquo;Louis, who promises afresh
to keep his promise better. This 20th of September,
I beseech M. de F&eacute;nelon to take it again.&rdquo;
He was at this time but eight years old. The child
loved his teacher passionately, and it was seldom
that he did not yield speedily to F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s wise and
loving discipline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Once, however, there was a serious scene between
them which appears to have had a lasting influence
upon the prince. F&eacute;nelon had been obliged
to reprove him with more than usual severity, and
the boy, in his angry pride, had resisted, exclaiming,
&ldquo;No, no, sir; I remember who I am, and who
you are.&rdquo; It was impossible to pass over such a
speech and maintain authority; but acting upon
his own maxim, never to administer reproof while
either actor concerned is excited, F&eacute;nelon made no
reply, and for the remainder of the day preserved
a total silence toward his pupil, who could not fail
to perceive by his manner that the usually indulgent
master was much displeased. Night came with no
explanation. But the next morning, as soon as the
prince was awake, the abb&eacute; came into his room,
and, addressing him in a grave, ceremonious manner,
very unlike the usual easy tone of their intercourse,
said: &ldquo;I do not know, Monsieur, whether
you remember what you said to me yesterday, that
you knew what you are and what I am; but it is my
duty to teach you your ignorance alike of both.
You fancy yourself a greater personage than I&mdash;some
of your servants may have told you so; but
since you oblige me to do it I must tell you without
hesitation that I am greater than you. You must
see at once that there can be no question of birth
in the matter. It is one of personal merit. You
can have no doubt that I am your superior in understanding
and knowledge; you know nothing but
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
what I have taught you, and that is a mere shadow
compared with what you have yet to learn. As to
authority, you have none over me, whereas I, on
the other hand, have full and entire authority over
you, as the king has often told you. Perhaps you
imagine that I think myself fortunate in holding the
office I fill about yourself; but there again you are
mistaken. I undertook it only to obey the king,
and in no way for the irksome privilege of being
your preceptor. And to convince you of this truth
I am now going to take you to His Majesty and
beg of him to appoint some one else whose care of
you will, I hope, be more successful than mine.&rdquo;
This was no idle threat; for F&eacute;nelon had always
been determined to resign the tutorship as soon as
he felt himself to be failing in it; and the prince was
obliged to weigh his pride against his love. His
love proved the greater; for life had been very different
with him since F&eacute;nelon came into it, and no
sacrifice of his vanity was too galling if he might
cancel his offense and keep his friend. Moreover,
he was sensitive to the last degree to public opinion
and the faintest shadow of disgrace. What would
the world think of a prince who was so hopelessly
naughty that a man so universally admired and respected
was forced to give him up, and what would
become of the poor little boy to whom his nearest
relatives were, after all, only &ldquo;His Majesty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; if the dear, kind preceptor, who
loved him and devoted himself so entirely to him,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
were to go away? Poor Louis! The storm broke
out anew; but this time it was of penitence and
shame and regret, while with passionate sobs and
tears he cried out: &ldquo;O Monsieur, I am so sorry for
what I did yesterday. If you tell the king he will
not care for me any more; and what will people
think if you leave me? I promise, O I promise
ever so much, that you shall not have to complain
of me if only you will promise not to go.&rdquo; But
F&eacute;nelon would promise nothing&mdash;the lesson would
be lost if it were not sharp&mdash;and for a whole day
he allowed the duke to undergo the pangs of anxiety
and uncertainty. But at last, when his repentance
seemed unlikely to be soon forgotten,
Madame de Maintenon&rsquo;s intercession was admitted,
and the preceptor consented to remain.</p>
<p>At a much later date F&eacute;nelon, writing about
these days to a friend, said of the prince: &ldquo;He
was sincere and ingenuous to a degree that one only
needed to question him in order to know whatever
he had done wrong. One day, when he was very
much out of temper, he tried to conceal some act
of disobedience, and I urged him to tell the truth,
remembering that we were in God&rsquo;s sight. Then
he threw himself into a great passion, and said,
&lsquo;Why do you put it in that way? Well, then, since
you ask it so, I can not deny that I did that,&rsquo; whatever
it was. He was beside himself with anger, but
still his sense of religious duty was so strong that it
drew forth the most humiliating acknowledgments.
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
I never corrected him save where it was really
necessary, and then with great caution. The moment
his passion was over he would come back to
me, and confess himself to blame, so that we had
to console him; and he was really grateful to those
who corrected him. He used sometimes to say to
me, &lsquo;Now I shall leave the Duke of Burgundy behind
the door, and be only little Louis with you.&rsquo;
This was when he was nine years old. Directly he
saw me doing any work for him he wanted to do
the same, and would set to on his own account. Except
in his moments of passion I never knew him influenced
save by the most straightforward principles
and most strictly in accordance with the teachings
of the Gospel. He was kind and gracious to
all who had a claim upon him; but he reserved his
confidence wholly for such as he believed to be religious
people, and they could tell him nothing about
his faults which he did not acknowledge with gratitude.
I never saw any one whom I should less have
feared to displease by telling him the harshest truths
concerning himself. I have proved that by some
wonderful experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be somewhat seen, we trust, from all this,
how great was the care and skill expended by F&eacute;nelon
on his most responsible and difficult task, and
how near an approach he made to imparting a model
education to his pupil. To his religious training,
of course, as well as to that which was more intellectual,
the greatest attention was given. It had a
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
large place in the many conversations held and the
many books put into his hands, chief among which
were the Sacred Scriptures. The law of self-denial
and self-restraint was continually inculcated,
that one must learn to imitate the Divine Master if
one would fulfill the purpose for which life was
given. The early religious impressions thus imparted
were so deeply wrought that they influenced
his whole after life. He was prepared with greatest
care for his first communion, taking it earnestly and
devoutly, and for the rest of his life he was a regular
and faithful communicant, receiving the sacrament
with a recollection and humility of bearing
which struck all beholders. A total transformation
was wrought in the royal pupil under the training
given, a transformation which amazed all who were
conversant with it. The Duke de Saint-Simon,
speaking of what a prodigy was wrought in a marvelously
short space of time, how the most terrible
qualities were changed into all the opposite virtues,
says: &ldquo;From the beast which I have described there
arose a prince affable, gentle, moderate, patient,
modest, humble, austere but only to himself, attentive
to his duties and sensible of their great extent.
His only object appeared to be to perform
all his actual duties as son and subject, and to qualify
himself for his future obligations.&rdquo; Madame de
Maintenon, in one of her letters, gives the same
testimony: &ldquo;We saw all those defects which alarmed
us so much in the youth of the Duke of Burgundy
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
gradually disappear. Every year produced in him
a visible increase of virtue. So much had his piety
changed him that, from being the most passionate
of men, he became mild, gentle, and complying;
persons would have thought that mildness was his
natural disposition, and that he was innately good.&rdquo;
So great was the alteration in his character and conduct
that, had he lived to ascend the throne, the
whole world, as well as France in particular, would
have been immensely the gainer. Hence the limitless
devotion with which F&eacute;nelon gave five or six
years of his life at the height of his powers entirely
to the royal children and the routine of their
schoolroom duties, was by no means a poor use of
his great gifts and attainments. These years are
extremely important, both in his own history and
the history of his country.</p>
<p>One other point deserves mention before we
pass from this interesting period of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s life.
In entering on his office he laid down to himself a
rule, to which he rigidly adhered, never to ask of
the court a favor for himself, his friends, or his
family. The virtue of this stands out the more
when we consider how very rare in those days was
disinterestedness, and that men were none the less
esteemed because they strove to profit themselves
and their families to the utmost in whatever position
they filled. It is, then, not a little remarkable
and creditable that F&eacute;nelon actually continued in a
state closely approaching destitution; his means
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
were extremely straitened for more than five years
after entering upon his honorable and responsible
position at court. His private revenue was very
small, nothing at all coming to him at this time
from Carenac, which he describes as &ldquo;hopelessly
ruined.&rdquo; No pecuniary income, one writer says,
was attached to his office; but this is hardly credible,
and there are indications that there was a salary,
although, strangely enough, not an adequate
one. He kept a very small establishment, and it
was with great difficulty that he found means to
meet his current expenses. Letters to Madame de
Laval, a daughter of his uncle, the marquis, and
hence a sister to him, who was his guide and counselor
in money matters, show this. He wrote to
her, October, 1689, concerning the various economies
to which he was subjected, and the sale of his
carriage and ponies. Again, in March, 1691, he
mentions having repaid one thousand francs out
of a debt of twelve hundred due Madame de Laval,
and other sums to other people. &ldquo;I have made retrenchments,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;which are very unusual in
my position; but justice comes before all other considerations.
I still owe a considerable sum to my
bookseller, and I must buy some plate to repay you
for the things you have loaned me which are worn
out.&rdquo; He speaks of getting his accounts into order
that he may see his way in his small economies and
calculate how to go on. Again, in January, 1694,
he writes concerning a needy person whom he commends
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
to Madame de Laval, saying: &ldquo;Although
my necessities have never been so pressing as at
present, I beg you to take what is wanted for this
man. I am tolerably well, though very busy; but
my purse is at the lowest ebb, through delays in
the payment of my salary, and the exceeding dearness
of everything this year. If I do not receive
something shortly, I must dismiss nearly all my
servants. But I will not have you try to help me.
I would rather bear on. All the same, see that any
money that can be sent [from Carenac] reaches me
after the more urgent alms have been disbursed;
for indeed I would rather live on dry bread than
let any of the poor of my benefice want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This cousin became F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s sister actually, as
well as in name, by her second marriage with his
eldest brother, the Compte de F&eacute;nelon; and probably
it never cost him more to refuse anything than
when he refused her request that he would obtain a
valuable military post for her son, a child four years
old. But, while eager to do anything he deemed
right to please her, he steadily refused to make the
application she desired. He writes: &ldquo;I can not
relax the strict rule to which I feel it right in my
position to adhere. I would do anything on earth
for you or your son that I can, but not to save my
life would I ask for anything from the king.&rdquo; Other
letters that might be quoted speak the same language.
It was not till 1694 that the king seems to
have remembered or discovered how badly his
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
grandsons&rsquo; preceptor was provided for. In that
year, at last, he gave F&eacute;nelon the Abbey of St.
Valery, which sufficiently filled his purse. The
king informed him of this in person, and apologized
for so tardy an acknowledgment of his gratitude.
And the year before, 1693, he was chosen a member
of the French Academy, a high distinction; his
reception speech was made March 31st of that year.
It was at this time, also, that he became a considerable
factor in the management of the celebrated
community at St. Cyr, known as the ladies of St.
Louis, who were pledged to a devout and holy life.
Madame de Maintenon had originated the idea of
this foundation, with the special object of educating
and training five hundred girls, daughters of
the poorer nobility. It occupied a large share of
her thoughts. F&eacute;nelon was associated with Bourdaloue,
the Abb&eacute; Godet des Marais, subsequently
Bishop of Chartres, and other eminent ecclesiastics
in its government.</p>
<p>It was on February 4, 1695, that the king announced
to Abb&eacute; de F&eacute;nelon that he had nominated
him Archbishop of Cambrai, one of the richest
and most important sees in the kingdom. He
was taken entirely by surprise, but at once replied,
after expressing his thanks, that he could scarcely
rejoice in an appointment that would remove him
from the preceptorship to the princes. Whereupon
Louis graciously answered that the abb&eacute; was much
too useful to be spared, and that his intention was
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
that he should retain both offices. F&eacute;nelon represented
that the laws of the Church and his own
conscience made this impossible, as both required
residence in the diocese. But the king bore witness
to his appreciation of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s services by
overruling this difficulty, and replying, &ldquo;No, no;
the canons only require nine months&rsquo; residence;
you will spend three months with my grandsons,
and during the rest of the year you must superintend
their education from Cambrai just as you
would at Versailles.&rdquo; This point settled, F&eacute;nelon
went on to say that if he was indeed to accept the
archbishopric he must resign the Abbey of St.
Valery, an act of disinterestedness which Louis altogether
refused to allow. But F&eacute;nelon quietly
persisted, pointing out to the king that the revenues
of Cambrai were such as to make it an infringement
of canonical law to hold any other preferment
with it. Such conscientious indifference to his own
interest excited a great deal of astonishment and
gossip at court. The Bishop of Rheims remarked
that it was all very well for M. de F&eacute;nelon, thinking
as he did, to act thus, but that thinking as <i>he</i>
did, it was better for him to keep his revenues. The
age was thoroughly accustomed to this plurality of
benefices. In the previous century John of Lorraine
was at one and the same time Archbishop of
Lyons, Rheims, and Narbonne, Bishop of Metz,
Toul, Verdun, Theroneune, Lucon, Alby, and
Valence, and Abbot of Gortz, Fecamp, Clugny, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
Marmontier. He was also made a cardinal a year
or two before attaining his majority. This was
doubtless an extreme case, but there were plenty
somewhat similar. So that F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s self-denying
course meant a good deal more than it would at
the present day.</p>
<p>He was consecrated archbishop June 10, 1695, in
the chapel of St. Cyr, in the presence of a distinguished
throng, among whom were Madame de
Maintenon and his three royal pupils. Bossuet was
chief consecrator, the Bishop of Chalons being first
assistant, and the Bishop of Amiens second. F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
friends were delighted at this great advancement
for him; yet it was felt by many of them that
he should have had the Archbishopric of Paris, for
already the popular voice had widely and loudly
nominated him. Some thought that he was sent to
Cambrai by the king for the express purpose of
forestalling this clamor, and avoiding any necessity
for putting him in the more conspicuous and
influential place; for it was known that the post at
Paris would soon be vacant, and, if, at its vacancy,
F&eacute;nelon had been still unplaced, the pressure for
his appointment there would have been very strong.
As it was, M. de Harlai died August 6, 1695, less
than two months after F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s consecration. M.
de Noailles, Bishop of Chalons, through the influence
of Madame de Maintenon, was given the
position.</p>
<p>We have reached now what was, in a worldly
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
point of view, the very summit of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s prosperity
and glory. It might seem that, humanly
speaking, he had very little, if anything, left to wish
for, although, of course, the cardinalate might fairly
have been expected in a few years. But the clouds
were already beginning to gather which were soon
to break over his head in a storm never to clear
away, so far as court favor and the good things of
this world were concerned. So a new chapter must
be devoted to these new experiences which had so
very much to do both with his temporal and spiritual
affairs.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br />MYSTICISM AND QUIETISM.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></h2>
<p>In order that we may properly apprehend the
next period in F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s life it is absolutely essential
for us to take a survey of the general subject of
Mysticism, for with that he became now very intimately
concerned. And, happily, it is a subject of
perennial importance, having no less close connection
with the present day than with the centuries
past. Indeed the present age has in some respects
very special need of just this element. It is a commercial,
materialistic, money-grabbing age, devoted
to the outward and the practical; it is a time when
the triumphs of machinery and invention and industrial
progress are sounded as never before&mdash;an
extremely busy, bustling time of immense external
activity, when man hastens to get rich and rushes
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
through life at railroad speed, scarcely finding leisure
so much as to eat, much less for the quiet contemplation
of the things of the spirit. And it is
the contemplative, interior, spirit-filled life with
which Mysticism has pre-eminently to do.</p>
<p>The term, it is true, has come to be widely regarded
with suspicion, and used, more or less
vaguely, as a word of reproach. With many, perhaps
with most, it carries an unpleasant, offensive
suggestion. Its associations in their minds are with
that which is misty or recondite, visionary and unintelligible;
also with that which is fanatical, extravagant,
unreasonable, and somewhat dangerous.
That there is some ground for this impression can
not be denied, because under the general name of
Mysticism much has been included, in the long sweep
of the centuries, which can not be admired or defended;
much which does not commend itself to
that level-headed common sense according to whose
dictates we like to think that our religion can be
and should be squared. But we are persuaded that
this extreme objectionable development, or manifestation,
of the Mystic spirit has been much less
frequent than is commonly supposed, and has no
sufficient claim to be identified with it in the public
mind anywhere near as largely as it usually is.
There is a true Mysticism, and a false Mysticism.
There are Mystics every way worthy of highest
honor, and there are those not at all points deserving
imitation. It surely is a mistake to lay the chief
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
stress on the latter, as is so frequently done, and
thus to stamp a stigma upon all. Christian Mysticism
is something of which no one can afford to
be ignorant. The Church which neglects it or despises
it, whether through misapprehension or some
less honorable cause, is certain to be a large loser.</p>
<p>What is Mysticism? As has been pointed out
by several, it is something which from its very nature
is hardly susceptible of exact definition, does
not readily lend itself to the most precise forms of
language. It is a phase of thought or feeling which
continually appears in connection with the endeavor
of the human mind to grasp the Divine essence,
and to enjoy the blessedness of actual communion
with the Highest. It springs inevitably from intense
desire for intimate fellowship with God, from
the hottest possible pursuit of the highest ideals.
It is a sort of name for the realization of God as
transfused throughout the universe, as being immanent
in material things and in mankind alike. The
Century Dictionary defines Mysticism as &ldquo;any mode
of thought or phase of intellectual or religious life
in which reliance is placed upon a spiritual illumination
believed to transcend the ordinary powers of
understanding.&rdquo; The Standard Dictionary says
that Mysticism is &ldquo;the doctrine and belief that man
may attain to an immediate direct consciousness or
knowledge of God as the real and absolute principle
of all truth. The term is applied to a system of
thought and life of which the chief feature is an
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
extreme development of meditative and intuitive
methods as distinguished from the definitive and
scholastic.&rdquo; Similarly Dr. J. P. Lange, in the
Schaff-Herzog Cyclopedia, says: &ldquo;Mysticism has
been defined as belief in an immediate and continuous
communication between God and the soul
which may be established by certain peculiar religious
exercises.... There is a mystic element
in all true religion.&rdquo; Cousin says: &ldquo;Mysticism
is the belief that God may be known face to
face without anything intermediate. It is a yielding
to the sentiment awakened by the Infinite, and
a summing up of all knowledge and all duty in the
contemplation and love of Him.&rdquo; Nitzsch, in his
&ldquo;System of Christian Doctrine,&rdquo; declares &ldquo;that the
religious man, the man of faith, is, as such, a Mystic;
for he in whose consciousness God does not
appear, certainly does not feel God, nor can he
know or honor Him; but he who only thinks Him,
without loving Him and becoming pure in heart,
can not know Him vitally; much less can he behold
Him spiritually who desires to see Him with the
outward sense. The inner life of religion is ever
Mysticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is why in all ages of the Church, when the
outward has come to usurp and absorb attention,
when formalism and ceremonialism have dominated
the mind, when scholasticism has gained ascendency,
and especially when a corrupt looseness
of morals has set in to degrade the very ideals of
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
humanity, there have been those who have arisen
to make a stand for a purer, more fervent, more
spiritual type of piety. They have met, of course,
with bitter opposition; they have troubled those who
did not wish to be disturbed in their carnal indulgences
or worldly conformities, and they have had
various uncomplimentary epithets thrown at them:
such as, Pietists, Quietists, Mystics, Puritans,
Quakers, and Methodists. They have been misrepresented
in manifold ways. They have been persecuted
even unto the death. But they have been
the salt of the earth, and the succession has been
kept up under one name or another from the earliest
days to the present. They have not always
been endowed with philosophic minds or skilled in
the learning of the schools. They have been keenly
conscious of the difficulty, the impossibility, of completely
expressing, in imperfect human words, the
deep things of God revealed to them on the mounts
of vision with which they have been favored. They
have struggled hard with the inadequacy of the only
language at their command, and have been driven
to a liberal use of figures of speech, some of them
questionable in point of propriety. They have had
a cramped vocabulary, have made mistakes, have
not found themselves able to translate into intelligible
terms all that was in their minds. To mint the
secrets of the interior life into the current coin of
language suited to the comprehension of common
souls requires a skill given to but few. And more especially
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
have their expressions been found unintelligible,
or worse, by adversaries not qualified by any
experience to comprehend what it was all about.
For, as St. Paul says (<span class="sc">I</span> Cor. ii): &ldquo;The natural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God;
for they are foolishness unto him, and he can not
know them, because they are spiritually judged.
We speak wisdom among the perfect, God&rsquo;s wisdom
in a mystery, even a wisdom which hath been
hidden, which none of the rulers of this world
knoweth. Which things also we speak, not in
words which man&rsquo;s wisdom teacheth, but which the
Spirit teacheth, interpreting spiritual things to spiritual
men.&rdquo; The adversaries were also eager in
many cases to remove out of the way those who,
by their purity of life and their opposition to
priestly claims and gains, were esteemed dangerous
to the peace of the Church. We are confident
that in the main this is a fair interpretation of the
course which events have taken. Not but what
some of the Mystics have really laid themselves
open to the complaints of their enemies. They
have been unguarded in their language, have been
so carried away with ecstasy, as some new precious
truth has burst upon them, that they have stated it
too strongly; have not supplied the limitations and
modifications and exceptions which would have
been well, which were necessary for a complete
rounding out of the statement; have taken for
granted that the other side had been sufficiently emphasized
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
before, and that their special mission to
emphasize the neglected point would be recognized;
hence they have said things which, by strict construction
and taken in bald literalness, were not precisely
true. All this can be granted without casting
any serious reflection either on their character or
their doctrines. Their books must be read with caution
and discrimination. To persons not well balanced
they might sometimes be a source of peril.
But this admission is in no way incompatible with
the assertion that they have conferred a very great
benefit upon mankind, that their doctrines, on the
whole, are sound, and that this generation could ill
afford to overlook the good to be obtained by careful
studies in this direction.</p>
<p>The first Mystics were really St. John and St.
Paul; and their words have full justification in what
they derived from their Divine Master. Who more
positively than the great Apostle to the Gentiles,
&ldquo;according to the wisdom given unto him,&rdquo; preached
a gospel that was foolishness to some, but which he
continually called the wisdom and the mystery of
God; a gospel which proclaims the Divine indwelling,
we in Him and He in us, our bodies the temples
of the Holy Ghost, believers being &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo;
and &ldquo;members one of another?&rdquo; He was a man
caught up into Paradise, and hearing unspeakable
words which it was not lawful or possible for a
man to utter. &ldquo;I die daily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have been
crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I that live,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
but Christ liveth in me;&rdquo; &ldquo;To me to live is Christ;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have learned the secret, I can do all things in
Him;&rdquo; &ldquo;I fill up on my part that which is lacking
of the afflictions of Christ;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye died, and your
life is hid with Christ in God;&rdquo; &ldquo;In Him we live,
and move, and have our being;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spirit Himself
beareth witness with our spirit,&rdquo;&mdash;and many
other such like things there be, left on record from
his pen to show clearly that he was a true Mystic.
Still more, perhaps, do the Mystics look to St. John
for complete authorization of their position. His
Gospel is the spiritual Gospel, the charter of Christian
Mysticism. It is he who tells us, &ldquo;God is love,&rdquo;
&ldquo;God is light,&rdquo; &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The Divine union
which he sets before us is of the closest kind. &ldquo;Our
fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son
Jesus Christ;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye have an anointing from the Holy
One, and ye know all things;&rdquo; &ldquo;The anointing
which ye received of Him abideth in you, and ye
need not that any teach you;&rdquo; &ldquo;Hereby we know
that He abideth in us, by the Spirit which He hath
given us;&rdquo; &ldquo;He that believeth on the Son of God
hath the witness;&rdquo; &ldquo;He that dwelleth in love dwelleth
in God, and God in him,&rdquo; etc. It is impossible
to quote a tithe of the words in John&rsquo;s Epistles and
Gospel which embody the fundamental ideas of
Mysticism. Especially do we find in the marvelous
words of Jesus reported by John alone, as by the
one peculiarly fitted to formulate them, in the thirteenth
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
to the seventeenth chapters of his Gospel, the
seeds and roots of all which have been drawn forth
by subsequent writers on these profound themes.</p>
<p>Plato has been called &ldquo;the Father of European
Mysticism.&rdquo; Dr. Inge says: &ldquo;Both the great types
of Mystics may appeal to him,&mdash;those who try to
rise through the visible to the invisible, through nature
to God; and those who look upon this earth as
a place of banishment, upon material things as a
veil which hides God&rsquo;s face from us, and who bid us
seek yonder in the realm of ideas the heart&rsquo;s true
home. Plato teaches that the highest good is the
greatest likeness to God; that the greatest happiness
is the vision of God; that we should seek holiness,
not for the sake of reward, but because it is the
health of the soul, while vice is its disease; that
goodness is unity and harmony, while evil disintegrates;
that it is our duty to rise above the visible
and transitory to the invisible and permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Church has never lacked during its history
for those who have followed this line of thought
and cultivated this kind of experience. Clement of
Alexandria has been called &ldquo;the Founder of Christian
Mysticism,&rdquo; a Neoplatonist among the Fathers;
followed by Dionysius the Areopagite, and a lengthy
line of successors, large among whom looms the
noble Bernard of Clairvaux, the glory of the twelfth
century. Without tracing out the story in detail it
will be enough for our purpose to refer briefly to
those who, in the few centuries before F&eacute;nelon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
stood forth most prominently as leaders in this realm
of truth, and so prepared the way for him.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century we find a most remarkable
band of devout believers who called themselves
&ldquo;Friends of God,&rdquo; to signify that they had
reached that stage of Christian life when Christ, according
to His promise, would call them &ldquo;no longer
servants but friends.&rdquo; They were composed of
persons from all classes of society, and from all the
religious orders. Most prominent among these
were Master Eckhart&mdash;styled &ldquo;Doctor Ecstaticus&rdquo;&mdash;vicar-general
of the Dominican order, a man of
uncommon purity of life and great excellence of
character, one of the profound thinkers of the Middle
Ages; Henry Suso, who has been called &ldquo;the
Minnesinger of Divine Love,&rdquo; and who was wont
to say, &ldquo;A man of true self-abandonment must be
<i>un</i>built from the creature, <i>in</i>built with Christ, and
<i>over</i>built into the Godhead&rdquo; (he was prior of the
Dominican convent at Ulm, where he died in 1365);
Nicholas of Basle; and John Tauler. Nicholas was
a layman who wielded a powerful pen and was also
a great preacher; thoroughly devoted to religion
from his earliest days. He traveled much through
Germany, propagating his opinions in a quiet, unostentatious
manner, and gradually there grew up
around him a society of Christians composed of
men and women likeminded with himself, who loved
to honor him as their spiritual father. It seems to
have been largely his personal influence which held
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
them together, for they fell to pieces after he was
burned at the stake for heresy, near Poitiers, about
1382.</p>
<p>John Tauler&mdash;&ldquo;Doctor Illuminatus&rdquo;&mdash;born at
Strasburg, 1290, and dying there in 1361, was still
more distinguished, although indebted to Nicholas
for being led out into the light. This took place
when he was over fifty years of age. Nicholas,
coming to Strasburg to hear the famous preacher,
speedily detected his deficiency in spiritual experience,
and the lack of true power attending the Word
on this account. With rare humility, Tauler, a
learned theologian, received this rebuke from the
uneducated layman, and so profited by it that he
was able, though not without long struggle, to enter
into complete freedom. Then he preached in a very
different manner, and the first time he opened his
mouth in public fourteen persons fell as if dead
under the Word, and nearly thirty others were so
deeply moved that they remained sitting in the
churchyard long after the congregation was dismissed,
unwilling to move away. For eighteen
years after this second conversion he made great
progress in the divine life, rising to a place of highest
esteem with his brethren, and being rightly reckoned
among the chief of God&rsquo;s children on earth.</p>
<p>Properly to be counted among these Friends of
God can be set down the unknown author of
&ldquo;Deutsche Theologie,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Theologia Germanica,&rdquo;
which contained so much truth that it had the distinguished
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
honor of being put upon the Romish Index
of prohibited works. Luther ascribed it to
Tauler. It is in his style, and contains his sentiments;
but it is now considered more probable that
it originated a little later than his time, and was
written by some other member of the band. It was
their usual practice to conceal their names as much
as possible when they wrote, lest a desire for fame
should mingle in their endeavors to be useful.
Luther placed it next to the Bible and St. Augustine
as a source of knowledge concerning God and
Christ and man. Baron Bunsen ranks it still higher.
And many others have expressed their supreme indebtedness
to it for help in respect to the perfect
life. It has continued up to the present day to be
the favorite handbook of devotion in Germany.</p>
<p>Concerning the views and doctrines of these
Friends of God, although some of their expressions
and opinions may be objected to, considering the
corrupt age in which they lived they must be pronounced
worthy of high praise. They insisted, first
of all, on the uttermost self-renunciation, yet they
avoided the system of penances and austerities common
in the monasteries. Neither idle contemplation
nor passive asceticism found favor with them;
they were evangelical and practical, full of good
works and the imitation of Christ both in patient
suffering and active usefulness. They were animated
by an exalted reformatory spirit which threw
them out of touch with the ecclesiastics around
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
them. Though they did not in all cases fall under
the ban of the Church, they may still be regarded
as forerunners of the Reformation. Their Mysticism
was a powerful protest against the terrible
corruptions of the Romish Church and the cold,
barren speculations of scholasticism. They craved
and secured direct communion with God, unrestricted
by human interposition; an immediate vision
of the Almighty, undimmed by any separating veil
and unchanged by any distorting medium. The
highest form of the Divine life in a man seemed to
them to be perfect resignation to the will of God,
and they counted prayer to be the best means of
bringing about this state of resignation. &ldquo;To pray
for a change in one&rsquo;s circumstances,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;is
to pray that what God sends may be made subject
to us, not that we should submit ourselves to it;
and so tends to produce self-assertion, not self-renunciation.&rdquo;
Nicholas taught that &ldquo;when self-renunciation
is complete, the soul of man, having become
entirely resigned to the Divine will, becomes
so entirely assimilated to the Divine nature that it
has continually a near fellowship with God; he is
always in familiar intercourse with the Spirit of
God, who communicates to him all Divine knowledge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All things to the beloved are of God; all,
therefore, are indifferent.&rdquo; That religion which
sprang from fear of punishment or hope of reward
they counted of little worth, and considered love to
be by far the highest state, the only one truly
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
worthy of the Christian.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> Their union with Deity
was not that of pantheism but of passionate love,
and great prominence was given to the will as the
mainspring on which all developments of the higher
life depend.</p>
<p>The following quotations from &ldquo;Theologia Germanica&rdquo;
will convey in a few words what may be
called the root ideas of the book and of the men
whose spirit it so well embodies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A true lover of God loveth Him alike in having
and in not having, in sweetness and in bitterness,
in good or evil report; for he seeketh only
the honor of God, and not his own, either in spiritual
or natural things. Therefore he standeth
alike unshaken in all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All disobedience is contrary to God, and nothing
else. In truth, no thing is contrary to God;
no creature, nor creature&rsquo;s work, nor anything that
we can name or think of, is contrary to God or displeasing
to Him, but only disobedience and the disobedient
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
man. In short, all that is, is well-pleasing
and good in God&rsquo;s eyes, saving only the disobedient
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who is truly godlike complaineth of
nothing but of sin only. And sin is simply to desire
or will anything otherwise than the one perfect
good and the one eternal will, or to wish to have a
will of one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sin is to will, desire, or love otherwise than
God doth. Things do not thus will, desire, or love:
therefore things are not evil; all things are good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who is truly a virtuous man would not
cease to be so to gain the whole world; yea, he
would rather die a miserable death. To him virtue
is its own reward, and he is content therewith, and
would take no treasure or riches in exchange for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Union with God is brought to pass in three
ways; to wit, by pureness and singleness of heart,
by love, and by the contemplation of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A still greater name among the Mystic writers,
coming a bit later than those already mentioned, is
that of Thomas &agrave; Kempis, born near Cologne, in
this same West Germany where the Friends of God
flourished, in 1386, and dying about 1470. His
&ldquo;Imitation of Christ&rdquo; stands easily at the head of
its class, first in popularity and usefulness among
manuals for devotion. &ldquo;The epic poem of the inner
life,&rdquo; it has lent the fragrance of its sanctity to
every language of the civilized world, and has been
a prime favorite for nearly five hundred years with
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
all those who have made largest advancement in
holy things. Only a few extracts need be given to
show how closely it is in line with what has already
been said, and what remains to be said, concerning
the topic of our chapter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man is so far advanced in the Christian
life as not to seek consolation from any created
thing, then does he first begin perfectly to enjoy
God; his heart is wholly fixed and established in
God who is his All in All.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other occasion of perplexity and
disquiet but an unsubdued will and unmortified affections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-denial is the test of spiritual perfection,
and he that truly denies himself is arrived at a
state of great freedom and safety. It is no small
advantage to suppress desire, even in inconsiderable
gratifications. Restless and inordinate desires are
the ground of every temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abandon all, and thou shalt possess all; relinquish
desire, and thou shalt find rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No evil is permitted to befall thee but what
may be made productive of a much greater good.
Receive all with thankfulness, as from the hand
of God, and esteem it great gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that befalleth me I will thank the Love
that prompts the gift, and reverence the Hand that
confers it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord God, holy Father, be Thou blessed now
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
and forever! For whatever Thou willest is done,
and all that Thou willest is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The righteous should never be moved by whatever
befalls him, knowing that it comes from the
hands of God, and is to promote the important business
of our redemption. Without God, nothing is
done upon the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfection consists in offering up thyself, with
thy whole heart, to the will of God; never seeking
thine own will either in small or great respects;
but with an equal mind weighing all events in the
balance of the sanctuary, and receiving both prosperity
and adversity with equal thanksgiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is vanity but the love of God and a life devoted
to His will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing over St. Theresa and St. John of the
Cross<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>&mdash;particulars about whom may be found in
Vaughan&mdash;and denying ourselves, through limitations
of space, all quotations from Rodriguez and
Scupoli,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> who flourished in the sixteenth century,
and wrote divinely about Divine things, leaving the
world heroic examples of holiness,&mdash;we come to St.
Francis of Sales and Molinos, both of whom had
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
close connection with F&eacute;nelon, although in different
ways. Francis&mdash;born in 1567 and departing to
glory in 1622, who has been called &ldquo;the noblest,
tenderest and most devoted Mystic of the Catholic
Church after the Reformation&rdquo;&mdash;more than any
other, was F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s teacher in matters pertaining
to the inner life, even as Scupoli had been the
teacher of Francis. F&eacute;nelon never wearies of
recommending to the correspondents whom he is
instructing in spiritual things the perusal of the
works of this delightful and inspiring writer. He
says to one: &ldquo;You can read nothing better than St.
Francis of Sales. Everything he writes is full of
comfort and love; although his whole tone is that
of self-mortification, it is all deep experience, simple
precautions, high feeling, and the light of grace.
You will have made a great step when you are familiar
with such mental food.&rdquo; Upon another he
urges &ldquo;a half hour spent in meditative reading of
the Gospels in the morning, and an evening portion
of St. Francis de Sales.&rdquo; To the Elector of Cologne,
when about to receive episcopal consecration, he
says, &ldquo;Read the Life and Works of St. Francis
de Sales.&rdquo; We do not wonder at these counsels.
The two men, the two Francises, were
entirely congenial, marvelously alike in heart
and head, with similar vivacity, urbanity, and grace
of manner, polish of style, profundity of insight into
the soul, and practical knowledge of the world.
Both had high rank in State and Church, strong intellects,
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
intense devotion to God, and ability to express
truth in a simple, lucid, attractive way. They
were alike in that the profound piety they taught
was not, as in the previous age, reserved for the
cloister, but was quite compatible with mingling in
the world, requiring no great change of habits, but
an entire change of motive. Even the life at court
might be continued and graced with cheerful obedience
to the whole will of God; all the actions of
the day could be sanctified by a perpetual prayer
offered up in their midst and by a sincere intention
to please God; the humble every-day virtues were
extolled, and no austerities recommended. Thus religion
was made commensurate with the whole of
life, and the saint could join in all that others did,
except sin. No difference can be found in their
doctrines, or even their forms of expression, and it
seems like an irony of fate that the Bishop of
Geneva should be canonized in 1665 by the same
Church which condemned, in 1699, the Archbishop
of Cambrai. The fictitious and factitious reasons
that led to the latter will be detailed a little later.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is connected with the history
and fate of Miguel de Molinos, commonly esteemed
to be the founder of the Quietists. He was a Spanish
theologian, born of noble parentage near Saragossa,
December 21, 1627. He acquired a great
reputation at Rome and elsewhere for purity of life
and vigor of intellect, but steadily refused all ecclesiastical
preferment. In 1675 he published his
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
&ldquo;Spiritual Guide,&rdquo; which in a few years passed
through twenty editions in different languages, and
was warmly hailed by people of marked piety in
many lands. But it was soon bitterly attacked, especially
by the Jesuits, who quickly perceived that
Molinos&rsquo; system tacitly accused the Romish Church
of a departure from the true religion, and that his
whole doctrine would militate against the power
of the priesthood and the importance of ceremonialism.
Although he had a vast number of friends,
some of them eminent for learning and piety, and
even high in worldly rank, and though the pontiff
himself, Innocent XI, was partial to him, he was,
in 1685, cited before the Inquisition and subjected
to close examination as well as rigid imprisonment.
It is said that as many as twenty thousand letters
were found in his house, which, if true, shows the
degree to which the movement he headed had
spread, and the hunger of great multitudes for spiritual
food. His trial lasted two years, and in 1687
sixty-eight propositions, purporting to be extracted
from his book, were condemned, and he was declared
to have taught false and dangerous dogmas
contrary to the doctrine of the Church. He was
compelled to pass the remainder of his life in the
dungeons of the Inquisition, where he died, after
many years of close confinement, in which he exhibited
the greatest humility and peace of mind.</p>
<p>The principles of his book have been much misunderstood
and misrepresented. The following
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
statement is believed to be substantially correct. He
taught that Christian perfection consists in the
peace of the soul, springing from a complete self-surrender
into the hands of God, in the renouncement
of all external, temporal things, and in the
pure love of God free from all considerations of interest
or hope of reward. A soul which desires the
supreme good must renounce all sensual and material
things, silence every impulse, and concentrate
itself on God. In a state of perfect contemplation
the soul desires absolutely nothing, not even
its own salvation; it fears nothing, not even hell;
the one only feeling of which it is conscious is utter
abandonment to God&rsquo;s good will and pleasure; it is
indifferent to all else; and nothing which does not
reach the will, where alone virtue resides, can really
pollute the soul. The system was termed Quietism,
because it laid so much stress upon inward quiet,
passive contemplation, and silent prayer; also upon
freedom from hope and fear, the great agitators of
the human mind.</p>
<p>It is a very vulgar error to suppose that the
Mystics taught abstention from good works, or outward
inactivity; for none were busier in blessing
their fellow-men, as the twenty thousand letters
above mentioned might indicate, as well as the ceaseless
endeavors in this direction put forth by Madame
Guyon, F&eacute;nelon, and the rest. Mystics are not impracticable
dreamers; they have been in a very
marked degree energetic and influential. Their
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
passivity simply meant a calm yet glad acceptance
of all God&rsquo;s dispensations. They were also abundantly
active in the highest sense, since the old faculties
were transformed and uplifted and no longer
shackled by the cramping chains of sin, but enabled
to do far more for the good of mankind and the
glory of God in their happy, healthy working than
they ever had done before. They laid great stress
upon faith, rather than rites or austerities, as a
means of justification and sanctification, a peculiarity
which seems at the bottom of the remark of the
Romish ecclesiastic who wrote, under date of July
10, 1685, &ldquo;I am informed that a Jesuit named
Molinos has been put into the Inquisition at Rome,
accused of wishing to become chief of a new sect
called Quietists, whose principles are somewhat
similar to those of the Puritans in England.&rdquo; There
is sufficient similarity between the Quietism of the
seventeenth century and the Pietism and Methodism
of Germany and England in the eighteenth
century to give us a friendly feeling toward it. That
the former was not so well guarded as the latter;
was less directed to practical ends; was not in control
of such cool, sensible minds; ran very easily
into abuses; had stronger pantheistic leanings; was
more open to the objection that it taught a strained,
impossible perfection utterly out of reach of all but
the few, and attainable by those few perhaps only
under very favorable conditions,&mdash;may be freely
granted. But it does not, and need not, prevent our
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
sympathies going out strongly toward those who,
in that earlier day and amid much difficulty, struck
out the high path on lines not essentially at variance
with those who, in easier times of greater enlightenment,
came after them. The Mystics, with all
their extravagances, possessed more of the truth of
God than could be found elsewhere within the wide
domains of the Roman Church. The Reformers
recognized this, and sympathized far more deeply
with them than with the schoolmen.</p>
<p>It should be said, also, that the Quietists vehemently
repudiated the constructions put upon their
writings by their enemies, and the evil inferences
which were drawn from them. They protested
against what others professed to find there as being
no part of their real belief. It seems to us that they
have a perfect right to be heard in explanation of
their tenets, and much allowance must be made for
those endeavoring to find expressions that would
convey such profound and lofty thoughts. Professor
George P. Fisher, in his &ldquo;History of the
Christian Church,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The real ground of hostility
to Quietism was its tendency to lead to the
dispensing with auricular confession and penances
and outward rites altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be sufficiently evident from what has been
now written that there is Mysticism <i>and</i> Mysticism;
and that that which has the best right to the name
lies very close to the most essential truth of the best
religion, inseparable from it so far as it is to answer
the deepest yearnings of the human heart. If religion
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
is not to be made wholly objective, reduced
to a round of external performances, accounted
synonymous with philanthropy and morality; if its
subjective side is to have proper recognition as the
controlling one; if being is to take rank above doing,
as we firmly believe it should,&mdash;then we are
all Mystics in the true sense of the word. Since we
have to do with &ldquo;the love of Christ which passeth
knowledge,&rdquo; and which must be known by some
higher faculty than the understanding; since the new
birth is fitly compared by the Master to the mysterious
coming and going of the winds of heaven,
and can not be completely comprehended by the
human reason; since the method of God with the
soul of man passes all metes and bounds of man&rsquo;s
finite mind, and the operations of the Holy Spirit
can not be wholly fathomed by cold intellect,&mdash;Mysticism
has extremely close relations with all parts
of supernaturalism. It is grounded in a profounder
philosophy than those can offer who assume to
scout and scorn it. We as Methodists, especially,
believe firmly in feeling, and in a first-hand knowledge
of God as the privilege of each genuine believer.
We hold fast to experience as having rights
which logic and dogma must respect; we have exalted
life above theory, and the vision divine above
dead orthodoxy; we maintain that there is a God-consciousness,
as well as a self-consciousness and
a world-consciousness; and that spiritual facts can
be, and should be, verified in personal experience.
We count the words of Pascal divinely true: &ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
things of this world must be known in order to be
loved; but the things of God must be loved in order
to be known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysticism,&rdquo; says Professor J. E. Latimer, &ldquo;has
ever been a reaction from formalism and dogmatism
in religion. When Christian men have been
relying upon the letter, the Mystic has always exalted
the spirit. When the Church has been content
with mere dogmatic statement and intellectual
orthodoxy, a Mystic revival has come to rehabilitate
its spiritual life, and sends new streams of
power along its arid channel.&rdquo; Do we not greatly
need this revival now? We do not believe there is
any special danger to-day from one-sided subjectivity
and morbid introspection. The peril is altogether
the other way. Our great want is a profounder
apprehension of the basal truths of the
spiritual life, and their practical translation into
individual experience. The knowledge of God is
widespread, but it is superficial. Piety is very bustling,
but it is not deep. The utterances of the
Savior and His apostles are taken at a large discount,
and the mass of believers are easily content with a
low condition of spirituality. Hence the Church is
feeble, and fails to impress itself strongly upon the
world. It would be immensely benefited by a large
infusion of the spirit of the true Mystic, who wages
the most deadly war with all carnality; who has a
terrible moral intensity; who renounces absolutely
all that dims the radiance or shadows the image of
the Perfect One in the mirror of the soul; who is
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
determined, so far as in him lies, to bridge the gulf
that separates him from his Maker and make the
closest possible approach to God. Of Rabbi Gamaliel,
a genuine Mystic, it is reported that he prayed,
&ldquo;O Lord, grant that I may do Thy will as if it
were my will, and that Thou mayest do my will as
if it were Thy will.&rdquo; Charles Wesley, another Mystic,
is very bold and says,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let all I am in Thee be lost,</p>
<p class="t0">Let all I am be God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with
any that man may become a partaker of the Divine
nature? If to a small extent, why not, when all
the conditions are favorable, to a very large extent?
Why should not the Church in general, and
the Methodist Church in particular, get a new grip
on this much neglected but every way fruitful truth
of the Divine indwelling and the Divine immanence,
God in all and all in God, the universe but the will
of God expressed in forms of time and space, humanity
reaching its highest point of development
when it most completely entemples Deity, nature a
symbol of God, God revealed in His works? Just
so far as this shall be accomplished will the Church
swing out into a wealthy place, and march forward
to large conquest. Complete surrender will be the
prelude to complete possession, and complete possession
will straightway be turned into complete
victory over every foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br />THE GREAT CONFLICT.</h2>
<p>We come now to the central period of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
career, that wherein he put forth his greatest mental
exertion, fighting, as it were, for his very life,
and for that truth which he held much dearer than
life. It is a period which every sketch of him,
however brief, touches upon, and which we must set
forth at some length. The last chapter, on Mysticism
and Quietism, will have prepared us to consider
somewhat sympathetically the career of
Madame Guyon, who was so closely linked with
F&eacute;nelon during these few years, and who was the
chief exponent of the Quietist or Mystic beliefs at
this time in France. She was born, as Jeanne Marie
Bouvier de la Mothe, April 13, 1648, at Montargis,
about fifty miles south of Paris, and wedded before
she was sixteen, by the arrangement of her
parents, to a man of thirty-eight, M. Jacques Guyon,
who was very wealthy. She had an unhappy married
life, closed by the death of her husband when
she was twenty-eight. She had five children, two
of whom died in infancy. Suffering was her portion,
and religion her consolation, through all her
days. When not yet thirteen she read with eagerness
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
the Life of Madame Chantal, Kempis&rsquo; &ldquo;Imitation
of Christ,&rdquo; and the works of Francis of Sales,
making a vow at this time to aim at the highest
perfection and to do the will of God in everything.
Later, when seventeen, this determination was renewed
with fuller purpose and intelligence; yet it
was not till she was twenty, so limited were her
privileges of instruction, that her heart became thoroughly
changed, the pleasures of the world
put definitely aside, and her life devoted entirely
to God. Her education, in a convent, was
quite defective, but her natural abilities were very
great. She had remarkable powers of conversation,
her intellect was keen, her ascendency over other
minds, even some of the greatest, in after years was
very striking. She learned Latin subsequently, that
she might carry on her studies more profoundly.
She prepared extensive commentaries on the Scriptures,
and her writings, in their collective form,
were issued in forty volumes. Afflictions many
were used by the Lord to chasten her spirit and
deepen her experience. She lost her mother and
father, lost a dearly beloved son and darling daughter,
lost her beauty by the scourge of smallpox at
the age of twenty-two, lost her dearest friend and
religious confidante, Genevieve Granger, prioress of
the Benedictines, in 1673, and then her husband in
1676.</p>
<p>It was July 22, 1672, that she gave herself to
the Lord afresh, with larger comprehension and
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
consecration, without reservation of purpose or
time, in the most solemn manner, signing and sealing
the following covenant: &ldquo;I henceforth take
Jesus Christ to be mine. I promise to receive Him
as a husband to me, and I give myself to Him, unworthy
though I am, to be His spouse. I ask of
Him, in this marriage of spirit with spirit, that I
may be of the same mind with Him&mdash;meek, pure,
nothing in myself, and united in God&rsquo;s will; and,
pledged as I am to be His, I accept as a part of my
marriage portion, the temptations and sorrows, the
crosses and the contempts, which fell to Him.&rdquo; This
sacred covenant of the spiritual marriage with her
Redeemer, she carefully renewed and reviewed on
its anniversary. Especially noticeable was the renewal
in 1681, for it took place in Annecy, at the
tomb of St. Francis of Sales, who, more than any
other human being, was her master in spiritual
things, as he has been to hundreds of thousands
more. When left a widow with large property interests,
she first settled up the affairs of the extensive
estate with much skill, without assistance
from any one, did much in charity for those around
her, looked after her children, and then gradually
felt her way to what was to be her life-work in the
world. Her spiritual experience all the while was
advancing; she was sinking more thoroughly out
of self into God. July 22, 1680, was a specially
memorable epoch with her, when she began to count
the life of nature as fully slain within, when her
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
soul seemed to be delivered from all its chains, and
set wholly at liberty, in a way not known before.
She says, &ldquo;I had a deep peace; a peace which seemed
to pervade the whole soul; a peace which resulted
from the fact that all my desires were fulfilled in
God. I desired nothing; feared nothing; willed
nothing. I feared nothing; that is to say, I feared
nothing considered in its ultimate results and relations,
because my strong faith placed God at the
head of all perplexities and all events. I desired
nothing but what I now have, because I had a full
belief that in my present state of mind the results
of each moment, considered in relation to myself,
constituted the fulfillment of the Divine purposes.
I willed nothing; meaning in this statement that I
had no will of my own. As a sanctified heart is always
in harmony with the Divine providences, I
had no will but the Divine will, of which such providences
are the true and appropriate expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This extract expresses as well, perhaps, as anything
can, the mainsprings of her personal feeling
and the chief substance of her teaching. She always
beheld the hand of God in all things, recognized
practically that God orders and provides every
allotment in life, every situation, however distressing
to the flesh or perplexing to the perceptions.
She looked at everything on the side of God, and
found Him always manifested in His providences.
She was not merely consecrated <i>to</i> God&rsquo;s will, she
rested <i>in</i> His will, united to it by a most simple
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
faith, finding her joy in Jesus. All that had God
in it&mdash;and that included everything except sin&mdash;was
delightful to her. She found the order of Divine
providence a very precious and sufficient rule
of conduct; for she accounted that every successive
second, and every event, however minute, had something
about it which made known His will. Hence,
trusting fully, and finding God always everywhere,
nothing moved her. And she came to feel it to be
her special mission, since God had revealed these
things to her, as He had not to others, to proclaim
this particular kind of holiness; a holiness which
was a present privilege and possession, based upon
and secured by faith. This interior life, or &ldquo;inward
path,&rdquo; as she sometimes called it, or state of perfect
obedience to the will of God, had still another name
by which it came to be widely known&mdash;the name
of <i>disinterested</i> (or pure, perfect, unselfish) <i>love</i>. By
this was meant a love which served God for Himself
alone, uninfluenced by fear of punishment or
hope of reward.</p>
<p>She was led to go to the south of France, to
Gex, Thonon, Grenoble, Nice, Marseilles; and as
she taught these things to those who came within
her reach&mdash;and great numbers resorted to her&mdash;she
began straightway to endure the persecutions
which are promised by St. Paul to those who follow
the godly life. She preached reality rather than
forms. The two great principles which she clearly,
strongly proclaimed were self-renunciation and perfect
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
union with the Divine will; nothing in ourselves,
but all in God. She urged also the reading
and study of the Bible, which she constantly practiced
herself. These things, of course, brought
down upon her the severest opposition from the
ruling authorities in the Church. Some were jealous
of her because she was a woman; some were
rebuked in their sins; some felt that she was preaching
the heresies of Protestantism; some were offended
at the unaccustomed terms she employed.
The doctrine of full salvation by faith and complete
conformity to Christ crucified, never popular in any
age or land, was particularly obnoxious then and
there. When persecuted in one city she fled to another,
as the Savior directed, being in no haste to
justify herself, leaving her vindication, for the most
part, with God. She was able to do a great deal
for the Master in spite of continual opposition, being
occupied sometimes from six in the morning
till eight at night with those who came to her for
spiritual help, writing incessantly also, and scattering
her productions. She established a hospital in
Grenoble, and was at all times assiduous in rescuing
the fallen and doing good to the needy. In one of
her books written at this time, called &ldquo;The Method
of Prayer,&rdquo; she rightly says: &ldquo;No man can know
whether he is wholly consecrated to the Lord except
by tribulation. That is the test. To rejoice in
God&rsquo;s will when that will imparts nothing but happiness
is easy, even for the natural man. But none
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
but the religious man can rejoice in the Divine will
when it crosses his path, disappoints his expectations,
and overwhelms him with sorrow. Trial,
therefore, instead of being shunned, should be welcomed
as a test, and the only true test of the true
state.&rdquo; She nobly endured this test, not only at this
time, but still more signally as the years went on.
She arrived again in Paris, five years after her departure
from that city, July 22, 1686. Here she
became one of the little circle which met frequently
for religious and social purposes at the Hotel de
Beauvilliers, a circle which included Madame de
Maintenon and F&eacute;nelon.</p>
<p>When F&eacute;nelon was in the province of Poitou, at
work among the Huguenots in 1686, he first heard
of Madame Guyon and became somewhat acquainted
with her writings, which deeply interested
him, as they were drawn so largely from Francis of
Sales, his own chief teacher. On returning from
his mission in 1687, he passed through the city of
Montargis, and made there careful inquiries concerning
this woman. He was impressed, says M.
de Bausset, one of his biographers, &ldquo;by the unanimous
testimonies which he heard of her piety and
goodness.&rdquo; On returning to Paris he met her for
the first time at the house of the Duchess of Charost,
a few miles beyond Versailles, and again soon after
at the house of the Duchess of Bethune. This was
in the latter part of 1688, after her release from
her first imprisonment. For her enemies, among
whom was her half-brother, the Abb&eacute; la Mothe, had
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
followed her to Paris, accused her to Monsieur de
Harlai, the notoriously wicked archbishop, and he
easily obtained from the king, to whom it was represented
that her doctrines were substantially the
same as those of the heretic Molinos, a <i>lettre de
cachet</i>, or sealed order, putting her in confinement,
January 29, 1688. She refused to purchase her liberty
by the sacrifice of her little daughter, only
twelve years of age, whom the king wished to force
into a very unseemly marriage with a person who
wished to get possession of her large property. She
refused also to take other means for her release
which did not commend themselves to her as right.
She answered them, &ldquo;I am content to suffer whatever
it pleases God to order or permit, but I would
sooner die upon the scaffold than utter the falsehoods
you propose.&rdquo; Whether written at this time
or at some of her subsequent imprisonments, the
following hymn of hers so well represents her constant
attitude that it is eminently proper to insert
it here:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A little bird I am,</p>
<p class="t">Shut from the fields of air;</p>
<p class="t0">And in my cage I sit and sing</p>
<p class="t">To Him who placed me there;</p>
<p class="t0">Well pleased a prisoner to be,</p>
<p class="t0">Because, my God, it pleases Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Nought have I else to do;</p>
<p class="t">I sing the whole day long;</p>
<p class="t0">And He, whom most I love to please,</p>
<p class="t">Doth listen to my song;</p>
<p class="t0">He caught and bound my wandering wing,</p>
<p class="t0">But still He bends to hear me sing.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou hast an ear to hear;</p>
<p class="t">A heart to love and bless;</p>
<p class="t0">And, though my notes were e&rsquo;er so rude,</p>
<p class="t">Thou would&rsquo;st not hear the less;</p>
<p class="t0">Because Thou knowest as they fall,</p>
<p class="t0">That <span class="sc">Love</span>, sweet <span class="sc">Love</span>, inspires them all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My cage confines me round;</p>
<p class="t">Abroad I can not fly;</p>
<p class="t0">But, though my wing is closely bound,</p>
<p class="t">My heart&rsquo;s at liberty.</p>
<p class="t0">My prison walls can not control</p>
<p class="t0">The flight, the freedom of the soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O, it is good to soar,</p>
<p class="t">These bolts and bars above,</p>
<p class="t0">To Him whose purpose I adore,</p>
<p class="t">Whose providence I love;</p>
<p class="t0">And in Thy mighty will to find</p>
<p class="t0">The joy, the freedom of the mind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Her friends were not idle, and finally, by the
intercession of Madame de Miramion, Madame de
Maisonfort, and the Duchesses Beauvilliers and
Chevreuse, acting through Madame de Maintenon
upon the king, Madame Guyon was released in October,
1688. On being set free she took up her residence
at the house of Madame de Miramion, and
resumed her labor for souls as opportunity presented
itself. Early in 1690 her daughter was married
to Count de Vaux, a man of high character,
brother of the Duchess de Bethune and nephew of
the Duchess de Charost; and as the child was
scarcely fourteen she went to live with her a little
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
way out of the city. Here F&eacute;nelon visited frequently,
and when she had once more returned to
Paris, hiring a private house for herself there in
1692, he met her much.</p>
<p>What of her influence upon him? Those not in
sympathy with her ideas, by whom indeed the inner
things of the kingdom are pertly dubbed &ldquo;nonsense,&rdquo;
have called her &ldquo;the evil genius of his life,&rdquo;
and ascribed to her what they are pleased to term
his ruin and downfall. We are very certain that he
did not himself regard either it or her in that light.
They had very much in common. There was the
same hunger after the highest religious attainments,
and their ideas as to the path were at bottom the
same. F&eacute;nelon had the theological training which
she lacked, and hence found difficulty with many of
her expressions, which seemed to him objectionable
and liable to misapprehension, as doubtless they
were. But it seems altogether probable that at this
time she was more advanced in the spiritual life,
more perfectly taught of God, than he. Hence, in
the extended correspondence which took place between
them, covering a space of some two years or
more, from its beginning in November, 1688, it is
usually he who asks the questions and seeks for explanations.
She responded with entire patience and
deep religious insight, taking all possible pains, as
may well be supposed, with so distinguished yet so
docile a pupil. To one with so clear an intellect and
so sympathetic a spirit she could express her
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
thought with the utmost freedom, and his enlightened,
powerful mind, untrammeled by the prejudices
which so often prevented&mdash;and always prevents&mdash;correct
perceptions, readily saw the validity
of her views. She herself says: &ldquo;I was enabled in
our conversations so fully to explain everything to
F&eacute;nelon that he gradually entered into the views
which the Lord had led me to entertain, and finally
gave them his unqualified assent. The persecutions
which he has since suffered are the evidence of the
sincerity of his belief.&rdquo; If he was greatly indebted
to her, as everything appears to prove&mdash;and as
many other eminent men have been to godly women&mdash;for
getting into a much closer conformity to the
will of God, it is no wonder that he was never willing
to unite with her enemies in her condemnation,
although every earthly motive was on that side.</p>
<p>It was in 1692 that the acquaintance of Madame
Guyon with Madame de Maintenon became somewhat
intimate, so much so that she was often invited
to the royal palace at Versailles, and was introduced
to the celebrated institution at St. Cyr. Being given
liberty to visit the young ladies there, she talked
with them on religious subjects, and speedily acquired
the strongest possible influence over them.
This soon brought her name into general notice,
and excited once more intense hostility. One of
her servants was bribed to poison her, and almost
succeeded. She suffered from the effects for seven
years. It is at this time that Bossuet&mdash;confessedly
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
the leader of the French Church by reason of reputation,
learning, and intellectual strength&mdash;became
alarmed at the reports he heard of the strange influence
of this woman in high quarters, and determined
to put forth his splendid powers for the extinction
of what he deemed a new heresy. His first
interview with her took place in September, 1693,
his second, January 30, 1694. He found much to
admire in her positions, but he judged by the head
rather than the heart, and was not fully satisfied.
Accordingly she wrote to Madame de Maintenon,
asking that a number of suitable persons might be
selected to carefully examine her doctrines and her
morals; for her character as well as her teachings
had been loudly assailed, as is customary in such
situations. The king approved of the plan, and appointed
three commissioners, the most eminent for
virtues and talents that could well be selected,
which was a marked tribute to the intellectual power
and personal influence of Madame Guyon. They
were Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux; M. Tronson, Superior
of the Seminary of St. Sulpice; and M. de
Noailles, Bishop of Chalons, afterwards the Cardinal
Archbishop of Paris. These persons had
many meetings in 1694 and 1695, and drew up what
were known as the Articles of Issy. F&eacute;nelon, being
on terms of the greatest intimacy with these three
theologians, was in frequent communication with
them concerning the matter, and was often consulted,
especially by Bossuet, while the articles were
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
being framed. When they were completed he was
asked to sign them, which, after a few changes and
the addition of four articles which he deemed essential
to prevent misconception, he gladly did.
Even Madame Guyon gave her assent to them, although
they bore rather hardly on some of her positions,
without mentioning her name, and were expressly
designed to protect the public against her
alleged extravagances.</p>
<p>She was at this time in a sort of confinement in
the Convent of St. Mary, in Meaux, under Bossuet&rsquo;s
supervision. He had many interviews with her, and,
in a letter to the prioress of the convent, said expressly
that &ldquo;he had examined the writings of
Madame Guyon with great care, and found in them
nothing censurable, with the exception of some
terms which were not wholly conformed to the
strictness of theology; but that a woman was not
expected to be a theologian.&rdquo; He also, at her desire,
after six months&rsquo; residence, gave her a certificate
speaking in the most favorable terms of her
character and conduct. But no sooner was she
again in Paris than her enemies started at once into
life. The king was alarmed lest Quietism&mdash;a system
of faith and practice at the complete antipodes
from his own&mdash;should gain further currency, and
Madame de Maintenon, taking her cue from him, as
she always did, ranged herself promptly with its
enemies. Bossuet also, finding that he had been
more lenient toward her than was politic, demanded
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
back from Madame Guyon his certificate. This she
could not consent to surrender, and he set himself
with full determination to crush her. December 27,
1695, she was arrested and incarcerated in the castle
of Vincennes, where she underwent for nine
months a very severe imprisonment. She says: &ldquo;I
passed my time in great peace, content to spend the
remainder of my life there if such should be the
will of God. I employed part of my time in writing
religious songs.&rdquo; In August, 1696, she was
transferred to another prison at Vaugiraud, a village
near Paris, where she remained till September,
1698, and was then immured in one of the stern,
dark towers of the dreaded Bastile, where she remained
four years more in solitary confinement.
Just previous to her commitment there she writes:
&ldquo;I feel no anxiety in view of what my enemies will
do to me. I have no fear of anything but of being
left to myself. So long as God is with me, neither
imprisonment nor death will have any terrors.&rdquo; A
little later she writes: &ldquo;I, being in the Bastile, said
to Thee, O my God, if Thou art pleased to render
me a spectacle to men and angels, Thy holy will be
done. All that I ask is that Thou wilt be with me
and save those who love Thee. As for me, what
matters it what men think of me or what they make
me suffer, since they can not separate me from that
Savior whose name is engraven in the very bottom
of my heart. If I can only be accepted of Him, I
am willing that all men should despise and hate me.
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Their strokes will polish what may be defective in
me, so that I may be presented in peace to Him for
whom I die daily.&rdquo; Her language was:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In vain they smite me. Men but do</p>
<p class="t0">What God permits with different view:</p>
<p class="t0">To outward sight they hold the rod,</p>
<p class="t0">But faith proclaims it all of God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And similar are the beautiful words of her hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;My Lord, how full of sweet content,</p>
<p class="t0">I pass my years of banishment!</p>
<p class="t0">Where&rsquo;er I dwell I dwell with Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">In heaven, in earth, or on the sea.</p>
<p class="t0">To me remains nor place nor time:</p>
<p class="t0">My country is in every clime;</p>
<p class="t0">I can be calm and free from care</p>
<p class="t0">On any shore since God is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">While place we seek or place we shun,</p>
<p class="t0">The soul finds happiness in none;</p>
<p class="t0">But with a God to guide our way,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis equal joy to go or stay.</p>
<p class="t0">Could I be cast where Thou art not,</p>
<p class="t0">That were indeed a dreadful lot;</p>
<p class="t0">But regions none remote I call,</p>
<p class="t0">Secure of finding God in all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>She made no complaints of those who so cruelly
used her. &ldquo;They believed that they did well,&rdquo; was
her only comment. The Spirit of her Savior was
with her: &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know
not what they do.&rdquo; In her biography, written later,
she says, &ldquo;I entreat all such persons as shall read
this narrative not to indulge in hard or embittered
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
feelings against those who have treated me with unkindness.&rdquo;
Her sufferings were terrible, but the
fortitude and resolution with which she endured
them, the steadfastness of her faith, and the meekness
of her bearing, are worthy of all praise. She
does not seem to have doubted for a moment the
goodness and truth of God. Her theories were put
to the severest of tests, and they did not fail her.
It is marvelous that she lived to emerge from the
gloomy walls that were the grave of such numbers,
or that the tyrannical, bigoted king ever relented so
far as to let her go forth. She was liberated when
fifty-four years of age (it being evident that she
could not survive another year of imprisonment),
reduced to great feebleness, her constitution utterly
shattered. Yet her enemies were still afraid to let
her stay in the neighborhood of Paris; so she was
banished for the rest of her life to Blois, one hundred
miles away, on the river Loire. There, subjected
to constant maladies which often brought
her to the verge of death, but supported by abundant
spiritual consolations, she did good as she had
opportunity to the great numbers of people who
came to see her. Her departure from earth occurred
June 9, 1717, and was both peaceful and
triumphant. Just before death, writing to her
brother, she says, &ldquo;Whatever may happen, turn not
your eye back upon the world; look forward and
onward to the heavenly mansions: be strong in
faith, fight courageously the battles of the Lord.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
Writing to another friend, and referring to her
pains, which she said were so great as to call into
exercise all the resources and aids of faith, she
adds: &ldquo;Grace was triumphant. It is trying to nature,
but I can still say in this last struggle that I
love the Hand that smites me.&rdquo; She said in her
last hours, &ldquo;I rely for my salvation, not on any good
works in myself, but on Thy mercies, O my God,
and on the merits and sufferings of my Lord Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; She had no faith in the doctrine of transubstantiation,
read the Scriptures much, and urged
others to study them, insisting constantly upon the
necessity of a real sanctification of the heart by the
Holy Spirit. That she was one of the high saints
of God, her soul a real temple of the Holy Ghost,
can in no way be questioned. It is also certain that
she had great intellectual power, and in the main
taught most important and sacred truth. It is easy
to find fault with many of her expressions, but her
spirit is beyond praise. That she did on the whole
a grand good work and will have a high place in
glory, we are fully convinced.</p>
<p>We come now to the great conflict between Bossuet
and F&eacute;nelon. Up to this time they had been
friends, at least outwardly. But there are grounds
for believing that F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s growing and prospective
influence aroused the envy of the ambitious Bossuet,
who, no more than the king, was disposed to
brook a rival; and the Quietist controversy speedily
took on a character which brought the two bishops
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
into the most direct antagonism. Bossuet completed,
after long labor, early in 1696, an exceedingly
able book against Quietism, entitled &ldquo;Instructions
on the States of Prayer.&rdquo; He secured the
approval of the other members of the Conference
at Issy, and wished to append a favorable testimonial
from F&eacute;nelon also. The latter examined the manuscript
with care, and was obliged to withhold his
indorsement. He did so on two grounds: He
thought it contained an absolutely unqualified denial
of the possibility of the pure, disinterested love
of God; and he considered its censures of Madame
Guyon too personal and too severe. He was perfectly
aware that the refusal to comply with the
wishes of Bossuet would be a mortal offense to that
haughty, self-willed prelate, and would also displease
the king, probably blasting his worldly prospects.
But as a man of honor and of true Christian
principle he could not and did not hesitate.
Writing to M. Tronson at this time, he says, &ldquo;Am
I wrong in wishing not to believe evil sooner than
can be helped, and in refusing to curry favor by acting
against my conscience?&rdquo; He declared that he
would not attack &ldquo;a poor woman who is trodden
down by so many, and whose friend I have been,&rdquo;
for the sake of dispelling suspicion against himself;
that he would not speak against his conscience or
recklessly insult a person whom he had respected
as a saint. &ldquo;It would be infamous weakness in me,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to speak doubtfully in relation to her character
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
in order to free myself from oppression.&rdquo;
Other extracts from his letters at this time, had we
space to give them, would show conclusively the
high ground he took, the only ground which his
own character and self-respect, as well as his feeling
of gratitude toward the persecuted woman,
could possibly permit. Had he done otherwise,
what would the world now think of him?</p>
<p>His chief friends approved his course, but insisted
that he must write his views in full. He did
so, producing his elaborate work called &ldquo;The Maxims
of the Saints,&rdquo; published in January, 1697.
Without naming Madame Guyon, it was in fact her
defense, the exposition of her opinions as he understood
them, and as she had explained them to him
in private. It was hailed as a golden work by Cardinal
de Noailles, M. Tronson, the Bishop of Chartres,
and many other leading men of France.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> But
Bossuet was roused to fury. &ldquo;Take your own
measures,&rdquo; he said to these men; &ldquo;I will raise my
voice to the heavens against these errors so well
known to you; I will complain to Rome, and to the
whole earth. It shall not be said that the cause of
God is weakly betrayed. Though I should stand
singly in it, I will advocate it.&rdquo; But none better
knew than he that so far from standing singly in it
he had the warmest possible backing from the king.
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
Louis XIV had no love for F&eacute;nelon. He had raised
him to certain dignities, partly because of his uncommon
abilities, and partly because of his favor
with the public, rather than as a sign of any personal
attachment. F&eacute;nelon was, throughout his life,
the very embodiment of all that Louis did not like,
and this, considering Louis&rsquo; character, was one of
his chief glories. The two men were so far apart
in most things, and their minds were so differently
constituted that there was no common bond of sympathy,
and the only wonder is how they got along
together as well as they did. F&eacute;nelon, while possessing
a great superiority of genius, exhibited also
an elevation of moral and personal character of
which the king stood in awe, and he was glad that
the accusation of heresy gave him a good opportunity
to be rid of his uncomfortable presence.</p>
<p>The battle was now on, and it was between two
giants. Bossuet, the eagle, was essentially masculine,
marked by solidity, vigor, and logic. F&eacute;nelon,
the swan, was essentially feminine, filled with tenderness,
spiritual enthusiasm, aspiration. Bossuet
had the experience of age, F&eacute;nelon the full powers
of middle manhood; Bossuet had the greater skill
in argument, F&eacute;nelon the richer imagination. Bossuet
in style, it has been said, reminds one of the expansive
and philosophical mind of Burke, combined
with the heavy strength and dictatorial manner of
Johnson. F&eacute;nelon had a large share of the luxuriant
imagination of Jeremy Taylor, chastened by
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
the refined taste and classic ease of Addison. F&eacute;nelon
was naturally mild and forbearing in disposition,
but inflexible in his principles and incapable of
being influenced by pleasures on the one hand, or
by threats on the other; he was amiable without
weakness, firm without bitterness. Bossuet, on the
other hand, was a man of strong passions, accustomed
to ascendency, impatient of opposition, and,
as the contest went on, irritated by the unexpected
difficulties he encountered, he resorted to means
for the carrying of his cause which have left a lasting
stain upon his name. But F&eacute;nelon came forth
from the ordeal, even as John Fletcher did in his
controversy with Toplady, elevated all the higher
in the admiration of mankind. Bossuet, in the
course of the contest, referring to one of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
publications, made the following remark: &ldquo;His
friends say everywhere that his reply is a triumphant
work, and that he has great advantages in it over
me. We shall see hereafter whether it is so.&rdquo; F&eacute;nelon
thereupon addressed a letter to Bossuet in the
following terms: &ldquo;May heaven forbid that I should
strive for victory over any person, least of all over
you. It is not man&rsquo;s victory, but God&rsquo;s glory which
I seek; and happy, thrice happy shall I be if that
object is secured, though it should be attended with
my confusion and with your triumph. There is no
occasion, therefore, to say, &lsquo;We shall see who will
have the advantage.&rsquo; I am ready now, without
waiting for future developments, to acknowledge
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
that you are my superior in science, in genius, in
everything that usually commands attention. And
in respect to the controversy between us, there is
nothing which I wish more than to be vanquished
by you if the positions which I take are wrong.
Two things only do I desire&mdash;<i>truth</i> and <i>peace</i>;
truth which may enlighten, and peace which may
unite us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two combatants put forth all their strength,
and the conflict attracted the eyes of all Europe.
Book followed book in close and quick succession
on both sides. Each of the antagonists showed a
thorough mastery of the subject, and exerted himself
to the utmost, stimulated by the importance of
the struggle and the large issues at stake, not only
of a personal nature but of a general character. The
whole Christian world looked on with deep interest.</p>
<p>The chief doctrine that F&eacute;nelon set himself to
defend is summarized by Upham in the following
three propositions: &ldquo;First, the provisions of the
Gospel are such that men may gain the entire victory
over their sinful propensities, and may live in
constant and accepted communion with God; second,
persons are in this state when they love God
with all their heart; in other words, with pure or
unselfish love; third, there have been instances of
Christians, though probably few in number, who, so
far as can be decided by man&rsquo;s imperfect judgment,
have reached this state, and it is the duty of all, encouraged
by the ample provision which is made, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
strive to attain to it.&rdquo; But the main issue was
speedily confused with an abundance of side questions,
particular sentences and parts of sentences
being picked out for attack, much space being taken,
as in all such cases, with merely verbal criticisms
founded on misconceptions or on the necessary imperfection
of language. The celebrated Leibnitz
remarked that, before the war of words between
Bossuet and F&eacute;nelon began, the prelates should
have agreed on a definition of the word love, and
that such a definition might have prevented the dispute.
The worst thing was that Bossuet, driven to
extremities by the trouble he found in making headway
theologically and fearing defeat, descended to
a personal attack on F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s character, insinuating
things which he had not the audacity to state
plainly or the facts to substantiate. This, of course,
reacted. For F&eacute;nelon&mdash;against his own wishes, but
being shown the necessity of it by his friends&mdash;wrote
a marvelous reply, of which Charles Butler,
one of his biographers, and by no means a partisan
one, says: &ldquo;A nobler effusion of the indignation of
insulted virtue and genius, eloquence has never produced.
In the very first lines of it F&eacute;nelon placed
himself above his antagonist, and to the last preserves
his elevation. Never did genius and virtue
obtain a more complete triumph. F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s reply,
by a kind of enchantment, restored to him every
heart. Crushed by the strong arm of power, abandoned
by the multitude, there was nothing to which
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
he could look but his own powers. Obliged to fight
for his honor, it was necessary for him, if he did
not consent to sink under the accusation, to assume
a port still more imposing than that of his mighty
antagonist. Much had been expected from him; but
none supposed that he would raise himself to so
prodigious a height as would not only repel the attack
of his antagonist but entirely reduce him to
the defensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was seen at an early period of the controversy
that there was no probability of its being settled by
any tribunal short of that of the pope himself.
F&eacute;nelon, seeing the unscrupulous, powerful forces
that were arrayed against him in Paris, applied to
the king in July, 1697, for permission to go to
Rome under any restrictions His Majesty might
think appropriate. This the monarch absolutely refused,
knowing well, no doubt, that the personal
charm of the saintly disputant would be likely to
carry everything before it. He would only permit
him to send agents there to act in his behalf. F&eacute;nelon
himself he curtly ordered to proceed immediately
to his diocese, to remain there, and not to stop in
Paris on the way any longer than his affairs made
his stay absolutely necessary. F&eacute;nelon received this
undeserved sentence of banishment, very roughly
couched, with his customary calmness and submission.
In passing through the city he stopped before
the seminary of St. Sulpice, where he had spent so
many happy hours, and which he was never to see
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
again; but he forbore from entering the house lest
his showing a regard for it might expose its inhabitants
to His Majesty&rsquo;s displeasure. The king, with
his own hands, some time after this, crossed off
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s name from the list of court officials, and
also dismissed from service every one connected
with him, save only the Abb&eacute; Fleury, who, though a
devoted friend of the archbishop, had never taken
any part in the exciting topics of the day. But the
rest who had been employed about the Duke of Burgundy
for nine years, not blamelessly alone but how
successfully his altered character and advanced education
could show, were rudely sent off without any
acknowledgment whatever of their valuable services,
without even a civil word or a penny of reward.</p>
<p>And how went matters at Rome? The Abb&eacute; de
Chanterac, an intimate friend and relation, of highest
probity and piety, was F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s agent there.
The Abb&eacute; Bossuet, a nephew of the bishop, a vulgar,
blustering, unscrupulous fellow, with a most violent,
intemperate spirit, fitly represented the interests of
his uncle. The pope, Innocent XII, a man of a
benevolent and equitable temper, found his position
a very difficult one, somewhat similar to that of
Pilate at the trial of Jesus. His sympathies were
wholly with F&eacute;nelon, and there is no doubt that he
would gladly have given a verdict in his favor, or
dismissed the whole matter, could he have done so
without mortally offending the king. He had at
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
first hoped that the business might be settled in
France by mild and conciliatory measures, and had
expressed this wish to Louis; but the suggestion
was entirely unavailing. So he was obliged to take
up the very unpleasant task. He appointed a commission
of ten persons called &ldquo;Consulters&rdquo; to give a
thorough examination of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s books. But
after sixty-four successive and protracted sittings
of six or seven hours each, at many of which the
pope himself assisted, they found themselves so
evenly divided in relation to it that no satisfactory
result could reasonably be expected from the continuance
of their deliberations. The pope accordingly
selected a commission of cardinals to pronounce
upon the matter; but after twelve sittings
they were unable to come to any conclusion, and
were dissolved. Next a new congregation of cardinals
were selected, and met in consultation no less
than fifty-two times without getting on very far.
The long delays and the hesitation shown at Rome
to condemn F&eacute;nelon were utterly unexpected by
either Bossuet or the king, and made them furious.
Constantly increasing pressure was brought to bear
from Paris to secure the result pleasing to the monarch.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, in July, 1697, the king,
by Bossuet&rsquo;s instigation, wrote an urgent letter to
the pope calling upon him speedily to condemn
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s book. Missive after missive of similar
purport went forward, and all the arts of diplomacy,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
all the influences which Louis could in any way
exert, were unblushingly employed for F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
overthrow. Affairs at Rome, indeed, before long
involved themselves into a perfect tangle of chicanery
and intrigue, cardinal against cardinal, ambassador
against ambassador. Other courts besides
that of France took a hand. The imperial ambassador
worked hard for F&eacute;nelon; the Spanish minister
was zealous on the other side; and a smaller
potentate, Cosmo, Grand Duke of Tuscany, a dabbler
in theology, threw his weight in the latter direction.
The poor pope was violently pulled, now
this way, now that. He greatly liked F&eacute;nelon, admiring
his beautiful spirit and appreciating his
loyal attachment to the Holy See. He resented
the disgraceful attempt to browbeat him on the
part of the desperate king and the Bishop of Meaux,
a pragmatical, pugnacious bully. He could scarcely
see any way of censuring any of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s propositions
without censuring also other writers of the
same sort, like St. Bernard and St. Francis of Sales,
whom the Church had delighted to honor. It seemed
to him also, as was indeed the case, almost if not
quite wholly a dispute about words. As to a habitual
state of disinterested Divine love, the attainment
of which was said to be inculcated in F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s
writings, F&eacute;nelon himself uniformly declared his
opinion that a permanent state of Divine love, without
hope and without fear, was above the lot of man.
And Bossuet himself allowed that there might be
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
moments when the soul, dedicated to the love of
God, would be lost in heavenly contemplation, and
then love and adore without being influenced by
either hope or fear, or being sensible of either.
Their real ground of difference was, after all, very
small, and there was much to be said on both sides.
And, under all these circumstances, it is scarcely
surprising that it took so long to reach a decision.</p>
<p>It was postponed from month to month in the
hope that some chance&mdash;the death of the king or of
Bossuet&mdash;might relieve the pressure, and allow the
papal conscience its rights as against the papal
policy. As late as the autumn of 1698, a whole
year after the conference of the ten &ldquo;Consulters&rdquo;
began, five of them persisted, in defiance of every
pressure that could be brought to bear upon them,
in pronouncing the book to be absolutely orthodox,
and so proceedings had to be begun again. The real
issue of the struggle had probably never been doubtful
in case the French court insisted. For, as the
cardinals said: &ldquo;It will not do to fire great guns
at the king. Rome&rsquo;s wisest course demands of her
to yield to him whatever may be yielded without
wounding the first principles of religion.&rdquo; It is absolutely
certain that, but for this unseemly influence,
the decision would have been in F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s favor.
As it was, the pope and his advisers struggled hard
to wriggle out of their dilemma with as little violence
to their feelings and their honor as they could.
After it was settled that they must in some way
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
give the decision as the king so imperatively demanded,
there were a great many meetings of the
Conclave to decide on the precise form it should
take. This required months of wrangling and debate.
It was at first intended to issue a simple brief,
distinctly affirming that His Holiness did not
intend to condemn the author&rsquo;s explanations of his
book, but giving some general disapproval of certain
inferences drawn from it, and asserting the
Church&rsquo;s true doctrine as opposed to the Quietists,
without casting any blame on the Archbishop of
Cambrai. This would have been done had not Bossuet&rsquo;s
agents at Rome, assisted by the Cardinal Cassanata,
a man of most imperious will and overbearing
temper, exerted themselves to the utmost, fortified
by fresh letters from the king dictated by Bossuet,
insisting, with hardly veiled threats of the
direful consequences that would ensue from disobedience,
that the decision be &ldquo;clear, precise, capable
of no misinterpretation, such as is necessary to remove
all doubt with regard to doctrine and eradicate
the very root of the evil.&rdquo; Thus badgered and
driven and terrified, there seemed to be nothing to
do but submit; so at length, on the 12th of March,
the whole Sacred College was assembled at the
palace of Monte Cavallo, where the decree was accepted
by the whole body of cardinals, signed by
the pope in their presence, and immediately posted
in all the principal public places of Rome.</p>
<p>The book itself, strictly speaking, was not condemned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
but only twenty-three propositions which
purported to be extracted from it. The pope took
pains to say, and to have it clearly understood, that
they were condemned, not in the sense which they
might bear or in the sense in which they were explained
by F&eacute;nelon himself. The propositions were
said to be condemned because, not being worded in
conformity with the author&rsquo;s real intentions, they
might insensibly lead the faithful to errors already
condemned by the Catholic Church; because they
contained words which, in the sense that more immediately
presented itself were rash, ill-sounding,
offensive to pious ears, and erroneous. The cardinals
refused to associate the name of heretic, or of
anything resembling heresy, with F&eacute;nelon&mdash;his
name, indeed, was not once mentioned in the brief&mdash;and
they absolutely rejected the usual appendage
to a brief of condemnation, an order for the book
to be burned. Very little was really decided. The
words were very gentle, and in important ways noncommittal.
Disinterestedness in the larger sense
was neither asserted nor denied; all that was done
was to prune F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s system of what might be
considered its extravagances. In pronouncing, on
the whole, against the &ldquo;Maxims,&rdquo; Rome had not
really declared for Bossuet. F&eacute;nelon could lawfully
tell his friends that disinterestedness was not condemned,
but only its exaggerated statement; self-interest
had not been made an essential condition
of our love of God,&mdash;it was still possible to love
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
Him for Himself, provided that hope and desire of
heaven were not habitually of set purpose excluded.
All this soothed the sorrows of the friends of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s,
as it was designed to do, and considerably
mortified his enemies, which mortification was increased
by a <i>bon mot</i> of the pope, which was soon
in every mouth, that &ldquo;F&eacute;nelon was in fault for too
great love of God; and his enemies equally in fault
for too little love of their neighbor.&rdquo; The pope,
indeed, had repeatedly called F&eacute;nelon &ldquo;a very great
archbishop, most pious, most holy, most learned;&rdquo;
and he gave to the Abb&eacute; de Chanterac every indication
of the extreme reluctance with which he moved
in the matter.</p>
<p>It was, on the whole, a very barren victory for
Bossuet; but he accepted it rather than run any
further risk in the long-drawn-out contest, of which
all parties were thoroughly weary. It had cost him
dear in both reputation and character. No one now,
however small his admiration for F&eacute;nelon, attempts
to defend the steps which Bossuet took or the dishonorable
means to which in his desperation he resorted
to compass his end. He contended not lawfully,
and deserves no crown. He showed an irritation,
rancor, bitterness, and malignity most lamentable;
used invective, artifice, and garbled quotations;
sullied himself forever by the course he took.
With brutal irony and savage harshness he hectored,
threatened, plotted, violated confidences, and
made accusations as base as they were reckless. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
used without scruple secret writings which he had
received from Madame Guyon, private letters written
to him by F&eacute;nelon during their early intimacy,
and a letter which, under the seal of friendship,
F&eacute;nelon had written to Madame de Maintenon,
and which in this trying hour she unfeelingly communicated
to Bossuet, having entirely changed in
her attitude toward him since the king&rsquo;s animosity
was evident. Bossuet&rsquo;s personal charges against
his amiable and estimable adversary, not believed
by any one, showed the innate smallness of his nature,
the desperate strait to which he was driven,
and the degree to which he had let jealousy and
rivalry of one greater than he take possession of
his bosom. That he himself was of plebeian birth&mdash;a
bar which kept him from the goal of his ambition
in the cardinalate&mdash;while F&eacute;nelon was of the
patricians, had doubtless something to do with it.
He squandered his waning powers on a controversy
which added no luster to his reputation, and brought
him no nearer to the summit of his desires. Too
late he realized that it was impossible to ruin such a
man as F&eacute;nelon in the eyes of those who had learned
to love him. He might be banished from the Vatican
and from Versailles, silenced by the pope, and
disgraced by the king, but he was cherished none
the less in the hearts of the devout, idolized and
adored as an oracle of piety and virtue.</p>
<p>F&eacute;nelon was not once betrayed into abuse or
slander throughout the struggle in which he had so
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
much at stake. No unkind word respecting any of
his persecutors escaped him. He continually exhibited
wonderful gentleness and dignity, elevated
self-respect, the urbanity of a refined gentleman,
and the grace of an exalted Christian. His style
was forcible and effective, but with no mixture of
sarcasm. Posterity has done him justice; has affirmed
that throughout this contest no stain rests
upon his moral character, and that he was absolutely
sincere when he said, &ldquo;I ask God to grant M. de
Meaux as many blessings as he has heaped crosses
upon me;&rdquo; <i>curses</i>, he might have said. All this
while his enemies were using every means &ldquo;to hunt
him down like a wild beast;&rdquo; this was the expression
they used. &ldquo;Never once,&rdquo; says a person who has
thoroughly examined the entire correspondence, &ldquo;in
the mass of letters that F&eacute;nelon sent to his confidential
agent at Rome, do we come across a mean
or unjust expression; there is not one letter that
one feels inclined to wish had not been kept for
the sake of the writer.&rdquo; As attack after attack descends
upon him, intended to humiliate and crush,
he rises above it, greater and nobler, more faithful
in following his Master&rsquo;s footsteps than ever. He
continually implored the pope to stop the endless
war of pamphlets which was doing so much harm
to the cause of religion and the Church. It was
with the greatest reluctance that he was forced into
the fight. Under the grossest of libels he would
have remained silent had his friends consented. But
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
he was compelled by the actions of his adversaries
to speak out sometimes with great vigor. And he
had to obey the voice of his conscience and the dictates
of chivalry, being thoroughly indignant at the
unjust treatment accorded to his friend, Madame
Guyon. His grief at the rupture of the bond between
him and Bossuet was deep and sincere. He
wrote, &ldquo;God alone knows what pain it is to me to
give pain to one for whom, in all the world, I have
the most attachment and respect.&rdquo; He wrote this
even when he was defending himself from the most
virulent attacks; and he would not have called God
to witness to a profession that was not absolutely
true. By his candor and simplicity, his openness
and gentleness, the beauty of his genius, and the
reputation of his virtue, he commanded the widest
possible respect from all who were capable of appreciating
these things. His challenge to his maligners
rang out without ambiguity: &ldquo;I fear nothing,
thank God, that will be communicated and examined
judicially. I fear nothing but vague report
and unexamined allegation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>F&eacute;nelon, when the decision at Rome was communicated
to him, acted as his friends had expected,
although some of them had hardly dared hope that
even he could rise so magnificently to the occasion.
He accepted, simply, sincerely, sweetly, with no
reservation or concealment or half-heartedness,
what he regarded as, under the circumstances, the
voice of God. His brother, the Compte de F&eacute;nelon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
heard the tidings first in Paris, and started instantly
for Cambrai, thinking that the reception of the news
through a kindly channel might at least lighten
somewhat the blow. He arrived on the Festival of
the Annunciation, just as the archbishop was about
to preach in the cathedral. However keenly he felt
the blow&mdash;and he was, of course, human&mdash;he was
not disconcerted, or cast down, or perplexed. Pausing
a little to arrange his thoughts, he threw aside
his intended sermon, and preached on the duty of
absolute submission to authority. The congregation,
among whom the news was already whispered,
was most profoundly impressed with the calm dignity,
the noble simplicity of their beloved chief pastor;
and the eyes of most overflowed with tears of
admiration, affection, grief, and respect as they
listened to his heartfelt words.</p>
<p>He was not a little harassed, as the days went
on, by some zealous, well-meaning folk, who feared
that he might not do the best thing, and wrote him
long exhortations to submit, telling him of the glory
he would find in such humiliation and the heroism
he would achieve. He wrote to Beauvilliers: &ldquo;All
this wearies me somewhat; and I am disposed to
say to myself, What have I done to all these people
that they think I shall find it so difficult to prefer
the authority of the Holy See to my own dim
knowledge, or the peace of the Church to my own
book? However, I am well aware they are right in
attributing large imperfections to me and much
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
shrinking from an act of humiliation; therefore I
can easily forgive them.&rdquo; He wrote: &ldquo;Doubtless
it costs one something to humble one&rsquo;s self; but the
least resistance to the Holy See would cost me a
hundred-fold more, and I must confess that I can
see no room for hesitation in the matter. One may
suffer, but one can not have a moment&rsquo;s doubt.&rdquo;
He also said: &ldquo;Amid these troubles I have the comfort,
little appreciated by the world, but very satisfactory
to those who seek God heartily, namely, that
my course is clear, and I have nothing to hesitate
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His enemies sought in vain to find a flaw in his
submission. One of his followers wrote: &ldquo;Your
conduct is a living exemplification of the maxims
of the saints;&rdquo; as indeed it was. The dignified
humility with which he met misfortune gave him
added reputation. He sent out a pastoral letter,
short and affecting, which comforted his friends
and afflicted his enemies, falsifying every prediction
which they had made of the nice subtleties and
distinctions with which he would seek to disguise
his defeat. His letters at this time breathed in all
cases the most amiable spirit of peace and resignation.
But in general he declined all writing and
discourse on the subject, and at an early moment
dismissed the controversy as far as possible from
his thoughts. The Bishop of Chartres wrote to
F&eacute;nelon that he was delighted with his perfect submission:
&ldquo;I have no words to express how my heart
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
is affected with your humble and generous action.&rdquo;
The pope wrote most kindly, and all the cardinals,
except Cassanata, sent messages to F&eacute;nelon by the
Abb&eacute; de Chanterac, conveying their respect and
attachment. &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; wrote the abb&eacute;, &ldquo;to
praise more than they did your submission, your
pastoral letter, your letters to the pope, and the
whole of your conduct.&rdquo; As one eminent person
wrote from Rome, &ldquo;He was more glorious than if
he had never been condemned.&rdquo; The Chancellor
d&rsquo;Aguesseau writes that F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s submission made
him the hero of the day. &ldquo;It stands the solitary example
in history of a controversy upon a point of
such moment which one single sentence terminated
at the instant, without its reproduction in any other
form, without any attempt to reverse it by power
or elude it by distinctions. The glory of it is due
to F&eacute;nelon, who was able to see that a very great
desire to justify one&rsquo;s self often does more harm
than good, and that the surest way to obliterate
wrongs unjustly imputed is to let them be forgotten
and die out in silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>F&eacute;nelon said, &ldquo;In all this, so far from referring
it to my opponents, I see no human agent; I see
God only, and I am content to accept what He
does.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the name of God,&rdquo; he writes to a friend,
&ldquo;speak to me only of God, and leave men to judge
of me as they like. As for me, I shall seek only
peace and silence.&rdquo; He had no resentment toward
any one; but he steadily refused, with proper dignity
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
and uncompromising adherence to the right, to
utter one syllable which could be perverted into a
semblance of retraction. He said that since the
head of the Church, with its superior light and
authority, had so judged, he must believe himself to
have insufficiently explained his meaning, but he
declared, in justice to himself, that he never understood
the text, or supposed any one else could understand
it, save in the sole sense which he had
himself assigned to it. While ready at all times to
meet his opponents in the humblest and most peaceful
spirit, as he declared, he declined to enter into
any negotiations that would imply a yielding of
what concerned his conscience or his sense of truth
in order to win them. He ceased to write and converse
upon the subject from this time. But in the
discharge of his duties among his own people and
in his correspondence, he never ceased to inculcate
the doctrine of pure love. He thought it his duty
to avoid certain forms of expression, and certain
illustrations which had been specifically condemned
in the Papal Decree, and which were liable to be
misconceived, but he went no further. How could
he? Nor do we find that room to wonder, which
some have done, at the heartiness and promptness of
his submission to what he doubtless felt was, from
a human point of view, unjust. He refused to confine
himself to the human point of view. He held,
with General Charles George Gordon, and many
others in our own day, that, however we may rightly
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
struggle to alter events while they are in the process
of formation, when once they have come to pass
they register a decree of the Almighty, and any reluctance
to receive them is rebellion against Him,
something not to be thought of by a truly loyal
heart. This theory and practice made earth to him
very heavenly, and life a triumphant march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br />THE GOOD ARCHBISHOP.</h2>
<p>It is now our privilege to bid farewell to the
noise of battle, and look at the good archbishop in
the peaceful retirement of his great diocese, where,
as all admit, his episcopal duties were perfectly performed.
Even the most captious carpers and cavilers
at F&eacute;nelon, who can see little or no good in any
other part of his life and try hard to find some unworthy
motive at the bottom of the acts that seem
so fair, are sore put to it, when they come to this
portion, to withhold a meed of hearty praise. They
are forced to admit that his misfortunes have helped
his character, and that he shines forth with a luster
rarely, if ever, equaled. What he would have become
spiritually had the world continued to smile
upon him is, of course, unknown. Had Louis XIV
died and the Duke of Burgundy come to the throne,
F&eacute;nelon would undoubtedly have reached the cardinalate
for which his birth and abilities so well
fitted him, and might even have gone higher. But
it is not likely that, in the vitiated atmosphere of
the court, and surrounded by the temptations inevitably
awaiting on unclouded success, his character
could have developed as it did in affliction.
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Some measure of adversity seems to be essential
to bring out the best there is in us. His career has
been called by some superficial observers &ldquo;a splendid
failure,&rdquo; but the words have no meaning except
in the sense in which they might be used of Jesus
of Nazareth and a multitude of others who have
stood for the highest ideals and have died nobly
fighting against wrong. F&eacute;nelon did not falter in
his course; he obeyed at eve &ldquo;the voice obeyed at
prime;&rdquo; he held to the end the supreme purpose
which had inspired his earliest reflections. But
his years of exile, spent in the single-hearted service
of his people, are a more impressive and edifying
conclusion to a life begun under the auspices of St.
Sulpice than if they had been attended with all the
glories of the papal court. His reverses of fortune
gave him an admirable opportunity, magnificently
improved, to show that his high theories of resignation
and self-surrender, and a serene acceptance of
everything from God&rsquo;s hand, could work well in
practice. Under the stress of his troubles he gained
new depth and breadth of piety, new self-reliance
and self-control, larger tranquillity, a more thoroughly
compacted character.</p>
<p>Cambrai, to which, he was banished in 1697, and
where he spent the last eighteen years of his life,
was a town of no great size or beauty, on the river
Scheldt, in the extreme north, near the Flemish
frontier. It was the ecclesiastical center of the
Flemish provinces which were conquered during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
early half of the reign of Louis XIV, and confirmed
to France by the treaty of Nimwegen in 1678. Formerly
a dependency of the chaotic Empire, there still
clung around it some of the prestige of departed
glories when its bishop&rsquo;s jurisdiction extended over
Brussels, and he governed the territory with almost
the power of an independent sovereign, having his
own fortresses and garrisons and mint. F&eacute;nelon
himself ranked both as a Prince of the Holy Roman
Empire and as a Duke of France, and, though possessing
no feudal privileges, he was still the principal
landholder of the province, with a floating
revenue of some hundred thousand francs, perhaps
about a hundred thousand dollars in modern money.
It was one of the first positions in the kingdom;
but it had some serious drawbacks, especially as a
place of permanent residence. He had said on receiving
the appointment, &ldquo;All is vanity and vexation
of spirit; I am entering on a state of perpetual
servitude in a strange land.&rdquo; The people there
were Flemings, not Frenchmen, in their language,
their habits, their modes of thought, with little refinement
of any kind, their virtues as coarse-fibered
as their manners. It was no small privation for a
man like F&eacute;nelon&mdash;born for Olympus as it were,
bred to the best society, and fitted to shine in it with
so much luster, and in a time when, even more than
now, everything centered around the court at the
capital&mdash;to be shut out from it all, losing the sympathy
and friendship which his earlier years had
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
brought him, the daily intercourse with minds that
reflected his own thoughts yet inspired and exhilarated
him. For one in the flower of his manhood
and at the zenith of his capacities, possessing
the gift of language in a marvelous degree, with
a filled and cultured brain, to be thrown so absolutely
out of his element, out of the world of books
and intellectual equals, exiled to a remote corner
of the realm amid strangers, was a calamity whose
gravity, on one side, it would be wrong to overlook.
His sufferings, as nature goes, must have been
acute. Yet he speedily adjusted himself to the situation,
and there is no note of repining. For mere
court favors, its dignities, pomps, and pleasures, he
had no real love, and his whole life bears witness to
the truth of his often repeated assertions, that he
had no wish to return to Paris or Versailles; no
wish, that is, under the divinely appointed circumstances;
for he was able always to find in such circumstances
his highest pleasure. Writing to the
Duke de Beauvilliers in November, 1699, he says:
&ldquo;I am sorry, dear duke, to be separated from you,
the dear duchess, and a very few other friends. But
for all else I rejoice in being away; I sing my canticle
of thanksgiving for deliverance, and nothing
would cost me so much as to have to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He by no means settled down into &ldquo;a state of
passive quietism,&rdquo; as some ignorantly prate, wholly
misconceiving both quietism and the man. The
slightest scanning of the records shows how beautifully
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
and zealously active his last years were. If
ever a man threw himself into the interests of
others, or made the deep love of God, which he
breathed as his native air, take loving shape in
strenuous acts, it was F&eacute;nelon. He was quiet, even
as was Madame Guyon, and as all other high saints
have been, in so far as to rest with an absolute, unhesitating,
unquestioning faith in God&rsquo;s keeping,
asking nothing save that His will might be perfected
in him; but he was most active and energetic in
body, soul, and spirit for his neighbor&rsquo;s good. The
unremitting labors which he undertook, and which
his vast diocese if properly administered demanded,
involved a life of the most regular industry. He
gave but a short time to sleep, and his working
hours began early, so that he had done nearly a
day&rsquo;s work before saying mass. His habit was to
say this in his own chapel, after a long time spent
previously in prayer, except on Saturdays, when he
said it in the cathedral, remaining there to hear the
confessions of penitents of any and every class who
chose to present themselves. He not infrequently
preached in the cathedral, but seems to have preferred
the town churches, in some one of which he
always preached the Lenten discourses. He made
no effort at oratory, aiming chiefly to be plain and
intelligible, excluding from his sermons superfluous
ornaments as well as obscurity and difficult reasonings.
He preached from the heart rather than from
the head, and generally without notes, but not without
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
much meditation and prayer. He used to say,
&ldquo;I must spend much time in my closet in order to
be prepared for the pulpit, and to be sure that my
heart is filled from the Divine fountain before I
pour out the streams upon the people.&rdquo; He declared
against the practice of committing sermons
to writing and then learning them by heart.</p>
<p>To his clergy he was a father and brother in
God, gathering them about him as constantly as possible
for instruction and inspiration, moving among
them with the utmost wisdom, correcting, advising,
assisting. One of his first cares was the improvement
of the seminary for completing the education
of those who were preparing for the Church. It
had been at Valenciennes, but he removed it to Cambrai,
that it might be under his own eye. It was his
great desire to reconstruct it on the lines of the
seminary at St. Sulpice, where he himself had been
so profited, and to intrust the supervision of the students
to priests who were members of that congregation;
but he found insuperable obstacles to this
scheme in the fear of M. Tronson lest any direct
connection between St. Sulpice and Cambrai might
draw down upon the former the king&rsquo;s displeasure.
So F&eacute;nelon appointed to the head of it his intimate
friend, the Abb&eacute; de Chanterac, formerly his agent
at Rome, saying, &ldquo;He has the wit, the piety, and
the wisdom to govern it peacefully.&rdquo; But F&eacute;nelon
devoted great personal care to the students, examining
them himself, and endeavoring to estimate their
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
individual capacities. Besides the instruction he
gave them during periods of retreat, and at the
chief festivals, he conducted conferences once a
week, listening with infinite patience to their difficulties
and replying with the kindness of a father.
No priest proceeded to ordination until he had been
five times examined by F&eacute;nelon himself. In short,
no pains were spared to make the priests of this
diocese an example to their degenerate colleagues.</p>
<p>In the general administration of his diocese he
concentrated all his powers, allowing nothing to
escape him, erring, if at all, on the side of mercy
and toleration, finding it difficult to believe many of
the charges brought against his clergy, and only
convinced by the most conclusive evidence. He abstained
from unnecessary acts of authority, avoided
all unnecessary display, removed what was blamable
by meekness and moderation, improved with prudence
and sobriety what was good. His administration
was uniformly wise, strict in some respects,
and yet on broad and liberal lines. There was no
harrying of Protestants or Jansenists, no bureaucratic
fussiness, no seeking after popularity, but
every man, great or small, was treated exactly as
was becoming. Between him and his flock, his
chapter, or his clergy, there was no discord.
Though by his indefatigable zeal he soon made the
district committed to his charge the model of a well-regulated
diocese, his biographers do not record of
him a single instance of what are generally called
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
acts of vigor, or a single instance of gaudy virtue.
The peace of heaven was with him, and was communicated
to all around. All local customs, down
to the humblest, were handled with a delicate touch,
and pardonable eccentricities of usage were never
dealt with severely. In the matter of patronage he
was careful that no outsider, and still less no relative
of his own, should swoop down on the richest
livings and secure by interest what the natives naturally
looked upon as their own by right. He
traveled throughout the district, making tours of
inspection several times a year, and so coming into
touch with every corner, preaching more than once
in every one of the six hundred parishes.</p>
<p>The laity adored him for his charities, for the
gentle firmness of his government, for the natural
grace of manner that enhanced a hundred-fold the
value of everything he said and did. Always ready
to help, yet always modest in offering assistance,
he seemed when about some kindly action to be receiving
rather than doing a favor. He was always
a perfect gentleman, a high-bred man of rank, a
model of politeness, and was equally adapted to
every grade of society. Men of all classes were
at ease in his company. He directed every one to
the subject he best understood, and then disappeared
himself, thus giving them an opportunity to produce
out of their own stock the materials they were most
able to furnish. Thus every one parted from him
well pleased with himself. Perhaps no one ever
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
possessed in a higher degree the happy talent of
easy conversation. His mind was entirely given up
to the person with whom he conversed. No one felt
his superiority; every one found him on his own
level. In visits to the sick at home, to the hospitals
and wounded soldiers, he was indefatigable, nor
was he a stranger to the Cambrai prisons. He went
into the cottages of the poor, and spoke to them of
God, and comforted them under the hardships
which they suffered. If, when he visited them, they
presented him with any refreshments in their unpretending
and unpolished manner, he pleased them
by seating himself at their humble table and partaking
cheerfully and thankfully of what was set before
him.</p>
<p>Various anecdotes illustrate his benevolence. In
one of his rural excursions he met with a peasant
in great affliction. Inquiring the cause, he was informed
by the man that he had lost his cow, the
only support of his indigent family. F&eacute;nelon attempted
to comfort him, and gave him money to
buy another. The peasant showed gratitude, but
still was sad, grieving for the cow he had lost, to
which he was much attached. Pursuing his walk,
F&eacute;nelon found at a considerable distance from the
place of the interview the very cow which was the
object of so much affection. The sun had set, and
the night was dark, but the good archbishop drove
her back himself to the poor man&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
<p>In February, 1697, before F&eacute;nelon had permanently
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
left Versailles, news came that a fire had
burned to the ground the archiepiscopal palace at
Cambrai, and consumed many or all of his books
and writings. His friend, the Abb&eacute; de Langeron,
seeing F&eacute;nelon conversing at ease with a number of
persons, supposed he had not heard these unpleasant
tidings, and began with some formality and caution
to inform him. But F&eacute;nelon, perceiving his
solicitude, interrupted him by saying that he was
fully acquainted with what had happened, adding
further that, although the loss was a very great one,
he would much rather they were burned than the
cottage of a poor peasant. This has been adjudged
a more touching and pious rejoinder than that of the
literary man whose library was destroyed by fire and
who replied to the tidings, &ldquo;I should have profited
little by my books if they had not taught me how
to bear the loss of them.&rdquo; F&eacute;nelon was taught compassion
for men and acceptance of the Divine will
from a higher source than books. At his own expense
he rebuilt the palace and furnished it in a
suitable style of magnificence, but he did not allow
the arms of his family to be affixed or painted on
any part of it.</p>
<p>The archbishop&rsquo;s day was very carefully laid
out, and has been quite minutely described. After
the early rising, the private devotions, and the public
services, he was visible until nine o&rsquo;clock to those
only who attended him by appointment. After that,
till he dined, his doors were open to all persons who
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
had business with him. Noon was the hour for
dinner. His table was suitable to his rank, handsomely
dressed, with a great variety and abundance
of good food, that his many guests might enjoy
themselves, but he himself was extremely abstemious,
eating only the simplest and lightest viands,
and of them but sparingly. Contrary to the custom
of most prelates, his chaplains, secretaries, attendants,
and all officers of the household, sat with him
at the same table, making a very harmonious household,
among whom conversation was briskly carried
on, F&eacute;nelon taking his part, but leaving every
one full scope. After dinner all went to the great
state bedchamber, which was very finely furnished,
but was used mainly as a sitting-room, F&eacute;nelon
himself sleeping in a little room adjoining, furnished
simply with some gray woolen materials and
only adorned with a few engravings. General conversation
was continued in the large room; but a
small table was placed before F&eacute;nelon, on which
he signed his name to papers which required immediate
dispatch, and took opportunity to give directions
to his chaplains on the affairs of the diocese.
He said grace both before and after dinner. He
spent the evening with those that were in the house,
whoever they might be, supping with the people
who happened to be present. Supper was at nine.
At ten the whole of the household assembled. One
of his chaplains read the night prayers, and at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
end of them the archbishop rose and gave his general
blessing to the company.</p>
<p>His chief amusement, when he found it necessary
to relax a little from his arduous toils, was
that of walking and riding. He loved rural scenes.
&ldquo;The country,&rdquo; he says in one of his letters, &ldquo;delights
me. In the midst of it I find God&rsquo;s holy
peace.&rdquo; Everything seemed to him to be full of
infinite goodness; and his heart glowed with purest
happiness as he escaped from the business and cares
which necessarily occupied so much of his time,
into the air and the fields, into the flowers and sunshine,
of the great Creator.</p>
<p>Many visitors came to him from far and near,
attracted by his great reputation, and the results of
the visits were always the same. Whatever the previous
sentiments or opinions, or indifferent or hostile
attitude, all were enchanted and moved to highest
admiration. The Abb&eacute; le Dieu, Bossuet&rsquo;s secretary,
and Canon of Meaux, in September, 1704, was
a guest at the palace, and noted everything with the
most minute and insatiable curiosity. He found
himself treated with the utmost consideration, and
given every opportunity to pry into all that interested
him, and came away with none but words of
hearty praise for all he saw.</p>
<p>A Scotchman, Andrew Ramsay, sometimes
called the Chevalier de Ramsay, scion of an old
Scotch family, exiled for his sympathy with the
Stuarts, sickened by many aspects of the Protestantism
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
in which he had grown up, wandered over all
Holland and Germany, hoping to find rest amid the
philosophers of those countries, but finding it not.
In this condition he came to Cambrai, where the
archbishop received him with his wonted fatherly
kindness, and speedily won his heart. The combination
of spiritual religion and practical wisdom
which he found in F&eacute;nelon, the height of his personal
holiness, and the daily-watched beauty of his
life, even more than the clear and helpful teachings
received, made so deep an impression oh him that
he became a convert to the Roman Church, and,
even when permitted to return to England, he remained
faithful to the doctrines which he had
learned at Cambrai. He continued there for many
months, never wearying of studying his host&rsquo;s mind
and soul, and eventually writing the first life of him
ever published. His literary powers proved of great
value in arranging the writings of his master and
defending him from calumny. Subsequently Ramsay
became teacher to some of the Pretender&rsquo;s family;
and there is an interesting story on record telling
how the friendship of F&eacute;nelon stood him in
good stead at Oxford some years after, showing
how in England the good archbishop&rsquo;s virtues attracted
highest esteem and his name had more influence
than even in France itself. In 1730 Ramsay
came to England under a safe conduct, and was
received as a member of the Royal Institution on
the strength of his connection with the Archbishop
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
of Cambrai. He further desired to take the Doctor&rsquo;s
Degree at Oxford. The Earl of Arran, then
chancellor of the university, proposed him for that
honor. Opposition arose in Convocation on the
double ground that he was a Roman Catholic and
had been a servant of the Pretender; but the opposition
ceased when Dr. King, head of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hall,
observed, &ldquo;I present to you a pupil of the illustrious
F&eacute;nelon, and this title is a sufficient guarantee to
us.&rdquo; Ramsay was admitted to his degree by a vote
of 85 to 17.</p>
<p>Another Britisher, the eccentric Earl of Peterboro,
in whom the hero, skeptic, and profligate were
mingled in about equal proportions, being among
the visitors to Marlborough&rsquo;s headquarters in the
Netherlands during the war, turned aside to Cambrai
to make its master&rsquo;s acquaintance. He could
have had very little sympathy with the saintly Mystic
there, but he could no more resist his charm
than could other men. He wrote subsequently to
the philosopher, John Locke, that F&eacute;nelon &ldquo;was
cast in a particular mold that was never used for
anybody else. He is a delicious creature, but I was
forced to cut away from him as fast as I could,
else he would have made me pious.&rdquo; He is also
reported to have written while there, &ldquo;On my word,
I must quit this place as soon as possible, for if I
stay here another week I shall be a Christian in
spite of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Munich, afterwards known as Marshal
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
Munich, one of the most distinguished commanders
in the armies of Russia, when young was a lieutenant-colonel
in the forces contending in Flanders.
Being taken prisoner in battle and conducted to
Cambrai, he was deeply affected by what he saw
of the peaceful mind and truly Christian generosity
of F&eacute;nelon. In all the vicissitudes of his after life,
in court and camp, he delighted to the very end of
his stormy career to remember the happy days
which he passed as a prisoner or ward in the society
of F&eacute;nelon. He found the recounting of the
things he had witnessed at Cambrai a help in soothing
the agitations of his own wild and turbulent
spirit and a means of permanent instruction in
righteousness.</p>
<p>The celebrated Cardinal Quirini, whose life was
devoted to learned researches and useful studies,
and who visited all parts of Europe in the prosecution
of literary purposes, speaks in the following
language of his interview with F&eacute;nelon: &ldquo;I considered
Cambrai as one of the principal objects of
my travels in France. I will not hesitate to confess
that it was toward this single spot, or rather
towards the celebrated F&eacute;nelon, who resided there,
that I was powerfully attracted. With what emotions
of tenderness I still recall the gentle and affecting
familiarity with which that great man
deigned to discourse with me, and even sought my
conversation; though his palace was then crowded
with French generals and commanders-in-chief,
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
towards whom he displayed the most magnificent
and generous hospitality. I have still fresh in my
recollection all the serious and important subjects
which were the topics of our discourse. My ear
caught with eagerness every word that issued from
his lips. The letters which he wrote me from time
to time are still before me; letters which are an evidence
alike of the wisdom of his principles and of
the purity of his heart. I preserve them among my
papers as the most precious treasure which I have
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His enemies, we are told, practiced the shameful
artifice of placing about him an ecclesiastic of high
birth whom he considered only as one of his grand
vicars, but who was to act as a spy upon him. The
man who had consented to take so base an office
had, however, the magnanimity to punish himself
for it. Utterly subdued by the purity and gentleness
of spirit that he witnessed in F&eacute;nelon, he
threw himself at his feet and confessed the unworthy
part he had been led to act, and withdrew
from the world to conceal in retirement his grief
and shame.</p>
<p>As will be inferred from these incidents his
hospitality to those who came to him from all parts
of Europe, as well as from near by, was unbounded.
In spite of the urgency and multiplicity of his employments
he was always ready, with the greatest
kindness of feeling, to pay the utmost attention to
all who had the slightest claim upon his time. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
did not hesitate to drop his eloquent pen, with which
he conversed with all Europe, whenever Providence
called him to listen to the awkward utterances of
the most ignorant and degraded among his people.
His practice and his preference was to suffer any
personal inconvenience, or sacrifice any private interest,
rather than injure the feelings of a fellow-man
or omit an opportunity of usefulness. Writing
to a friend about his daily routine he says: &ldquo;I
must confer with the Chapter on a lawsuit; I must
write and dispatch letters; I must examine accounts.
How dreary would be life made up of these perplexities
and details but for the will of God which
glorifies all He has given us to do!&rdquo; This is the
keynote on which F&eacute;nelon toned and tuned his life
at Cambrai, making himself the servant of all, ministering
rather than being ministered unto, glorying
in the honor of such services, fearful of the
outward pomps the Church conferred upon him, yet
accepting them in all simplicity because he fully believed
the Church to be directed by his Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him,&rdquo; says the Chevalier Ramsay,
&ldquo;in the course of a single day, converse with the
great and speak their language, ever maintaining
the episcopal dignity; afterwards discourse with
the simple and the little, like a good father instructing
his children. This sudden transition from one
extreme to the other, was without affectation or
effort, like one who, by the extensiveness of his
genius, reaches to all the most opposite distances.
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
I have often observed him at such conferences, and
have as much admired the evangelical condescension
by which he became all things to all men as
the sublimity of his discourses. While he watched
over his flock with a daily care, he prayed in the
deep retirement of internal solitude. The many
things which were generally admired in him were
nothing in comparison of that divine life by which
he walked with God like Enoch, and was unknown
to men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Galet, another of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s contemporaries,
bears loud witness to the fact that, however
grand the outside accommodations were, the
archbishop&rsquo;s personal appointments were of the
most modest description. He says that &ldquo;in the
meager simplicity of his private living rooms, fitted
up plainly in serge, of his dress&mdash;a long velvet cassock
trimmed with scarlet, but without gold tassels
or lace&mdash;even of his ecclesiastical vestments, F&eacute;nelon
did homage to that idea of holy poverty whose
actual practice was forbidden by his station in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when it came to others, F&eacute;nelon was very
considerate and very generous. When he had cause
to send his chaplains into the country on any business
of the diocese, it was always in one of his own
carriages and with one of his own attendants, that
the respect which he showed them might conciliate
to them the general respect of his flock. He took,
so far as possible, the burdens of his clergy on himself,
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
offered to pay more tax than he needed to,
even wasted (as it would now seem) money on beggars
whose appearance moved his sympathies. Yet
he also practiced sound economy, that he might
have the more to give, held a careful audit of his
household accounts, and set aside large portions of
his income for the starving soldiers, or the interests
of his seminary, or the education of his
nephews and their maintenance in the army. He
educated great numbers of students at his own expense,
sending them to Paris; especially the young
men that were likely to prove good priests, but
were too poor to bear the financial burden. He had
always a whole string of his nephews and grandnephews
or other relatives gathered about him,
young people whose education he was asked to
take charge of or those whose interests, for friends&rsquo;
or relationship&rsquo;s sake, he was desirous to promote.
He was never without the presence of children in
the palace. A suite of rooms above his own was
reserved for them. Not only his relatives, but the
sons of his intimate friends, were placed in his care,
that he might train them to be good and chivalrous
gentlemen. Very few of these boys were intended
for the priesthood, but the confidence that F&eacute;nelon
inspired was so great that it was believed a child
reared under his eye would be better fitted for court
or camp than if he spent his early years in the company
of princes at St. Germain or Versailles. The
last of his little guests were the grandchildren of
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
his friend, De Chevreuse, and, harassed though he
was by national disasters, he could spare time to
study and report upon them and express his pleasure
in their company. He wrote of the children, &ldquo;I
delight to have them here; I love them dearly; they
cheer me much; they do not trouble me in any way.&rdquo;
They were with him to the end; so that from the day
he entered on his duties at Versailles until his death
he may be said to have given a definite proportion of
his time and energy to the practical demonstration
of his excellent theories of education.</p>
<p>During the contest for the Spanish succession,
in the early years of the eighteenth century, between
France and Bavaria on the one side, and England,
Holland, and Austria on the other, the diocese of
Cambrai, not far from the Netherlands, which has
sometimes been denominated the battle-field of
Europe, was within the realm of war, and suffered
much from the cruel ravages of the advancing and
retreating armies. Under these circumstances,
F&eacute;nelon continued his constant visitations to every
part of the district, and all the writers dwell upon
the singular marks of homage paid on these occasions
to his eminent virtue by people of every name.
So far from putting any obstacle in his way, the
English, Germans, and Dutch took every means of
showing their admiration and veneration for the
archbishop. All distinctions of religion and sect,
all those feelings of hatred or jealousy which divide
nations, disappeared in his presence. He was
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
often obliged to resort to artifice to avoid the honors
which the armies of the enemy intended him. He
refused the military escorts which were offered him
for his personal security in the exercise of his functions,
and, with no other attendants than a few ecclesiastics,
he traversed the countries desolated by
war. His way was marked by his alms and benefactions,
and by a suspending of the calamities
which armies bring. In these short intervals the
people breathed in peace, so that his pastoral visits
might be termed a truce of God. The Duke of
Marlborough, the Prince of Orange, the Duke of
Ormond, the distinguished commanders who were
opposed to France, embraced every opportunity of
showing their esteem. They sent detachments of
their men to guard his meadows and his corn; they
caused his grain to be transported with a convoy to
Cambrai, lest it should be seized and carried off by
their own foragers. St. Simon, by no means his
friend, can not say enough in panegyric for his
never-ending kindness to the troops brought
through Cambrai during the war. The duke paints
him as moving among the sick and the whole, the
known and the unknown, the officers and the common
soldiers, with a knowledge of the world which
understood how to gain them all by treating each
in his due degree, and yet a true and cheerful shepherd
of their souls, as constant in his ministration
to the humblest as though he had no other business
in life. And he was no less careful for their bodily
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
comfort; lodged officers innumerable in his palace;
hired other houses besides for the same purpose;
filled them with the sick and wounded, and with
poor people driven from the neighboring villages;
tended the sick with his own hands, sometimes for
many months, until their entire recovery; supplied
the hospitals with costly drugs and endless streams
of food and delicacies, sent out, for all their abundance,
in such perfect order that every patient had
exactly what he needed. He was on the best of
terms with the nobles and government officials, not
only of his diocese but of all Flanders, even as far
as Brussels, and used his influence with them to
beg many temporal favors for his people; got his
village schoolmasters exempted from service in the
army, saved the farmers and their horses from
forced labors in the winter, and even warned the
Ministry at Paris that the devastated country could
be the theater of no more campaigns. When the
commissariat of the king was in extreme want of
corn, the archbishop emptied his immense granaries
for their subsistence, and absolutely refused all
compensation. He said, &ldquo;The king owes me nothing,
and in times of calamity it is my duty as a citizen
and a bishop to give back to the State what I
have received from it.&rdquo; It was thus he avenged
himself for his disgrace. At another critical moment,
only a timely advance from his own purse
prevented the garrison of St. Omer from going over
in a body to the enemy, as other unpaid regiments
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
had done. It is no wonder that he became the idol
of the troops, who sang his praises even in the antechambers
of Versailles. And his fame stood equally
high with those who were fighting against the king.</p>
<p>He was loved by so many because he was himself
so full of love. An instance of his largeness
both of mind and heart occurred during these closing
years, which deserves to be recorded, for it certainly
does not stand alone. The English prince
known as the Old Pretender was an officer in the
French army in 1709, and his duty took him near to
Cambrai. In the conversations which passed between
them, the archbishop recommended to him
very emphatically never to compel his subjects to
change their religion. &ldquo;Liberty of thought,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;is an impregnable fortress which no human
power can force. Violence can never convince; it
only makes hypocrites. When kings take it upon
them to direct in matters of religion instead of protecting
it, they bring it into bondage. You ought
therefore to grant to all a legal toleration; not as
approving everything indifferently, but as suffering
with patience what God suffers; endeavoring in a
proper manner to restore such as are misled, but
never by any measures but those of gentle and
benevolent persuasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even against the Jansenists, who were fierce
Augustinians, the ultra Calvinists of that time in
the matter of the Divine decrees, and whom he thoroughly
disliked, being himself a firm friend of free
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
will, he would by no means have harsh measures
taken. The sweetness of his disposition and his
idea of the meekness of God, made him strongly
averse to the doctrines of Quesnel and Jansen,
which he considered as leading to despair. &ldquo;God,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;is to them only a terrible Being; to me He
is a Being good and just. I can not consent to make
Him a tyrant who binds us with fetters, and then
commands us to walk, and punishes us if we do
not.&rdquo; In this he was at one with John Wesley. But
he would not, any more than the Methodist, permit
persecution of them in his diocese. &ldquo;Let us,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;be to them what they are unwilling that God
should be to man, full of compassion and indulgence.&rdquo;
He was told that the Jansenists were his
declared enemies, that they left nothing undone to
bring him and his doctrine into discredit. &ldquo;That
is one further reason,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for me to suffer
and forgive them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing that some peasants in Hainaut, who
were descended from Protestants, and who held still
the same opinions, had received the sacrament from
a minister of their own persuasion, but that, when
discovered, they disguised their sentiments and even
went to mass, he said to the Reformed minister:
&ldquo;Brother, you see what has happened. It is full
time that these good people should have some fixed
religion; go and obtain their names, and those of
all their families; I give you my word that in less
than six months they shall all have passports&rdquo;&mdash;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
is, to go where they like. The same clergyman,
whose name was Brunice, he received at his table
as a brother, and treated him with great kindness.</p>
<p>To an officer of the army who consulted him
to know what course he should adopt with such of
his soldiers as were Huguenots, F&eacute;nelon answered:
&ldquo;Tormenting and teasing heretic soldiers into conversion,
will answer no end; it will not succeed; it
will only produce hypocrites. The converts so
made will desert in crowds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closing years of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s life were inexpressibly
saddened by the number of deaths that
swept away in melancholy succession nearly all with
whom his heartstrings were most closely intertwined.
The first to go was his very dear friend
Langeron, who died at Cambrai, November 10,
1710. He probably held a deeper measure of his
love than any one else, possessed his entire confidence,
which was never in the least degree shaken
by mutual disagreement and reproof. He chose him
for a coadjutor on the mission to Saintonge, shared
with him the loving care of the little prince, to
whom he was reader, kept him with him at Cambrai
as one of his chief assistants and a principal amelioration
of the bonds which tied him there. Three
days after the death he wrote: &ldquo;I have lost the
greatest comfort of my life, and the best laborer
God has given me in the service of His Church, a
friend who has been my delight for thirty-four
years. O, how full of sorrow life is! O God, how
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
much our best friends cost us! The only solace of
life is friendship, and friendship turns into irreparable
grief. Let us seek the Friend who does not die,
in whom we shall recover all the rest. Nothing
could be deeper or truer than the virtues of him
who has died. Nothing could be a greater witness
of grace than was his death. I have never seen
anything more lovely and edifying.... God&rsquo;s
will is done. He chose to seek my friend&rsquo;s happiness
rather than my comfort; and I should be wanting
alike to God and my friend, if I did not will
what He wills. In the sharpest moment of my grief
I offered up him I so dreaded to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still keener, in some respects, was the loss he
experienced in the death of the Duke of Burgundy,
who passed away February 18, 1712. The ties between
them were of the closest description, and the
long separation of fifteen years had made no difference
in their mutual affection. When the young
man&mdash;fifteen years old at the time of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s banishment
in 1697&mdash;heard of the sad event, he ran to
his grandfather and flung himself at his feet, and
implored with tears his clemency, and as a proof of
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s doctrine appealed to the change in his
own conduct and character. Louis was deeply affected,
but said that what he solicited was not a
matter of favor; it concerned the purity of the
Church, of which Bossuet was the best judge. All
intercourse between the two was interdicted, and as
both were closely watched by spies, it was four
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
years before the slightest communication could pass
between them. Then the duke contrived to send a
letter in which he declared his unshaken love, saying
that indeed his friendship but increased with
time, and that he was proceeding more steadily than
before in the path of virtue. When, in 1702, Louis
gave the Duke of Burgundy command of the army
in Flanders, he petitioned with great earnestness
that he might be allowed in his passage to the army
to see F&eacute;nelon. The king consented only on condition
that the interview should be in public. They
met at a public dinner, where, of course, but little
could be said, as everything was closely watched.
But the duke in a loud voice exclaimed, in the hearing
of all present, &ldquo;I am sensible, my Lord Archbishop,
what I owe to you, and you know what I
am.&rdquo; F&eacute;nelon writes concerning the interview as
follows: &ldquo;I have seen the Duke of Burgundy after
five years&rsquo; separation, but God seasoned the consolation
with great bitterness. I saw him only in public
for a short quarter of an hour. One must take
things as they come and give one&rsquo;s self up unreservedly
to God&rsquo;s providence.&rdquo; After this, there
was opportunity for a more frequent correspondence,
and it is most creditable to both parties, filled
with affection and profoundest deference on the
part of the younger man, and with the deepest
solicitude and wisest counsels on the part of the
elder.</p>
<p>The duke&rsquo;s father, the dauphin, or heir apparent,
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
died in April, 1711, leaving, of course, his son as
next in the succession to the throne. Then, indeed,
did F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s hopes and the hopes of the nation rise
high. Cambrai became thronged with people who
thought it well to be in the good graces of one who
might very soon be the power behind the throne
and the most important man in France. But alas!
alas for human plans and prospects! The dauphine,
Burgundy&rsquo;s wife, died February 12th, of a strange
malady which baffled all the physicians; then the
duke himself, having caught the infection, died February
18th, and their eldest son succumbed to the
same complaint, March 18th. The royal household
was overwhelmed, the nation was stunned, and no
one felt the loss more than, probably no one as
much as, F&eacute;nelon. He writes: &ldquo;I am struck down
with grief; the shock has made me ill without any
malady. My health has suffered terribly, and whatever
revives my grief brings on a certain amount of
feverish agitation. I am humbled by my weakness.
All my links are broken; there is nothing left to
bind me to earth; but the ties which bind me to
heaven are strengthened. O, what suffering this
true friendship breeds! But if I could restore him
to life by turning a straw I would not do it, for it
is God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; It was undoubtedly the darkest hour
of his days. He never wholly rallied from the blow,
or took the same interest in his labors that he did
before. But there is the best of evidence that his
faith in God did not fail, and that in all the suffering,
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
both for himself and for his country, around
which the gloomiest shadows seemed now to be gathering,
he had no thought of the Almighty unworthy
of his goodness.</p>
<p>In November, 1712, died another most dearly
loved and life-long friend, the Duke of Chevreuse,
opening up all his wounds afresh, as he says; but
he adds, &ldquo;God be praised, be it ours to adore his
impenetrable purposes!&rdquo; In August, 1714, F&eacute;nelon
lost the last of that special group who had stuck to
him more closely than brothers, the Duke de Beauvilliers.
They had never met since he left Versailles,
but their hearts were most closely knit. &ldquo;Our
best friends,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;are the source of our
greatest sorrow and bitterness. One is tempted to
say that all good friends should wait and die on
the same day. Friendship will be the cause of my
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to be even so. His frame was feeble, and
these fierce attacks affected him severely. In the
following November a carriage accident entailed
another shock to his system, from which he had
not strength to recover. In the month that followed,
his friends recognized that he was failing visibly.
On the first of January he was attacked by a sharp
fever, and it began to be evident that the end was
near. For the whole of the six days that remained
to him on earth he permitted only the reading of
the Holy Scriptures. Over and over they read to
him 2 Cor. iv and v, especially the part about the
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
&ldquo;building of God, the house not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens.&rdquo; &ldquo;Repeat that again,&rdquo; he
said more than once. Other texts of Scripture particularly
suited to his condition were read to him
again and again. He would try to repeat them
himself with a failing voice, while his eyes and his
whole countenance were lighted up with a bright
expression of faith and love which the sacred words
inspired. Several times he asked those around to
repeat St. Martin&rsquo;s dying words, &ldquo;Lord, if I am yet
necessary to Thy people I refuse not labor; Thy
will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th he took the blessed
sacrament, being carried into the large state bedchamber
for the purpose, and gathering about him
his attendants, to whom he spoke a few farewell
words of tender exhortation. On the 6th he received
extreme unction, as one about to depart.
And immediately after, bidding every one, save his
chaplain, leave the room, summoning all his
strength, he dictated to him a few lines addressed
to P&egrave;re Lachaise, the king&rsquo;s confessor. Being thus
about to appear before God, he said: &ldquo;I have never
felt aught save docility to the Church and abhorrence
of the novelties attributed to me. I accepted
the condemnation of my book with the most absolute
unreserve. There never was a moment in my
life when I did not entertain the liveliest gratitude
and most honest zeal for the king&rsquo;s person, as also
the most inviolable respect and attachment. I wish
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
long life for His Majesty, of whom both Church
and State have so great need. If it be permitted
me to come before the presence of God, I will continually
ask this of Him.&rdquo; He makes in the letter
two requests of the king, neither of them for himself
or his family: First, that he will appoint to
Cambrai a pious, worthy, orthodox prelate; and
secondly, that he will allow the Cambrai seminary
to be intrusted to the Sulpician Fathers to whom he
owed so much. The rest of that day and the night
following he had much agony, and, in a feeble,
broken voice, said many times, &ldquo;Thy will, not mine.&rdquo;
He was surrounded by those who loved him best,
his two favorite nephews, the Abb&eacute; de Beaumont
and the Marquis de F&eacute;nelon, arriving in haste from
Paris. He gave them all his blessing as long as he
could speak. He passed away peacefully, amid the
tears of all around, at quarter past five in the morning;
aged sixty-three years, five months, and one
day.</p>
<p>He was buried in the cathedral of Cambrai, with
every tribute of honor and respect, but with all simplicity
and without ostentation, as he himself directed.
In his will, dated May 5, 1705, he wrote,
after declaring that he cherished no thought concerning
those who had attacked him save those of
prayer and brotherly love: &ldquo;I wish my burial to be
in the metropolitical church at Cambrai, as simple as
may be, and with the least possible expenditure.
This is not a mere conventional expression of humility,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
but because I think the money laid out on
funerals other than simple had better be kept for
more useful purposes; and also I think the modesty
of a bishop&rsquo;s funeral should set the example to the
laity and lead them to diminish useless outlay in
their burial arrangements.&rdquo; The last clause says:
&ldquo;While I love my family deeply, and am aware of
the needy state of their affairs, I do not think it
right to leave anything to them. Ecclesiastical
property is not meant to support family wants, and
should not pass out of the hands of those who minister
in the Church.&rdquo; It was found, when his affairs
were settled up, that after administering for
twenty years the great income of his office, which
was at his own absolute disposal, he ended a life of
persistent and rigorous self-denial with no money
in his coffers, and no debts to any man. His public
and private life had been ruled by the fundamental
principle which he did not fear to proclaim again
and again as his conception of truest patriotism: &ldquo;I
love my family better than myself; I love my country
better than my family; I love the human race
better than my country.&rdquo; All his days declared,
also, that he loved God best of all.</p>
<p>He stood for union with the Divine. He lived
ever in the eye of the All-Searcher. All his
thoughts and actions had been ruled by the purpose
to be perfectly pleasing unto Him. He had, no
doubt, failed at some points. He was ever ready to
confess it, and lament his weaknesses; for he was
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
human. But not many of mortal frame ever kept
more steadily before them from youth to age the
high endeavor to be as much as possible like Christ.
Neither disgrace nor disappointment daunted him.
The failure of earthly ambitions only impressed
on him the more that he had a message for mankind
that was above such things. And though there
were probably not many in his generation that were
ready to receive his lofty words, though there are
even now not many who are prepared to accept fully
his sublime teachings and follow him as he followed
the Master, yet there will always be an inward
witness in the hearts of some of every age
that responds to such voices, and leaps with joy at
the summons to put everything away, that God may
take full possession of His own. He was absorbed
in the hot pursuit of highest holiness. On this his
strength was concentrated. Only thus did he attain
the success that was vouchsafed him. The
spiritual life was to him the only real life. The
Presence Divine was ever with him. The Spirit of
God filled his heart.</p>
<p>During the outrages of the French Revolution,
in 1793, when the graves of the dead were being
brutally violated by order of the government with
wanton cruelty and savage merriment, and the
bodies of the great and noble, the learned and pious,
were being scattered to the four winds, an order
from government reached Cambrai directing that
all the leaden coffins that were there be sent to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
arsenal at Douay to be converted into instruments
of warfare. The agents proceeded to the Metropolitan
Cathedral, entered the vault under the altar,
took away the bodies of others, but left the remains
of F&eacute;nelon; not designedly, it would seem, for they
had no veneration for the talents and virtues of the
illustrious prelate; not accidentally, for what men
call chance is only the providence of God. It was
the counsel of unerring wisdom that issued the
commission, &ldquo;Touch not mine anointed and do my
prophet no harm.&rdquo; There are official documents
describing the finding of the body afterwards by
the mayor of Cambrai. The remains, in a fair state
of preservation, were reverently sealed up and replaced
in the vault. In 1800 the Emperor Napoleon
ordered that &ldquo;a monument or mausoleum be
erected to receive the ashes of the immortal F&eacute;nelon;&rdquo;
to which they were to be transferred in due
time. This was probably not carried out, as the
existing monument to F&eacute;nelon is in the new cathedral
of the date of 1825. But his chief monument
is in the hearts of men, in the veneration and affection
felt for him by the whole of Christ&rsquo;s Church
without distinction of name, and in the gratitude of
the many, many souls who have been helped on
their heavenward journey by his strong, wise words
and beautiful example.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br />THE SPIRITUAL LETTERS.</h2>
<p>It is fitting that we conclude this sketch of
F&eacute;nelon with some account of his writings, because
it is so largely through them that he lives today.
The most complete collection of his works, issued
from Paris between 1820 and 1830, is in thirty-four
volumes, 8vo, of which eleven volumes are
given to the correspondence. Many of these literary
labors have been translated into English; for
instance, the treatise on the &ldquo;Education of Daughters,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Dialogues on Eloquence,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Demonstration
of the Existence of God,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Spiritual
Letters.&rdquo; The last has by far the greatest importance
at the present time, has indeed an importance
for all time. But before taking it up, a few words
concerning some of his other productions will be in
place.</p>
<p>While he was superior at the institution for the
New Catholics, in 1687 or 1688, he wrote a treatise
on the authority of the priesthood or the dogma of
the Apostolical Succession, of course defending it;
which established his reputation as a writer, and
attracted the notice of the king. Much more important
was his work on the &ldquo;Education of Girls;&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
this has been sufficiently dwelt upon in the first
chapter. A treatise on the &ldquo;Existence of God&rdquo; was
begun in these earlier years, but leisure did not seem
to be found for its full development. Even the first
part was not published till 1712, and the second
did not see the light until three years after his death.
It is of little value now, but it made a strong impression
on the metaphysical philosophers of the
eighteenth century, and is especially praised by
Thomas Reid. His &ldquo;Dialogues on Eloquence,&rdquo;
with special reference to that of the pulpit (an admirable
treatise on oratory), was not published at
all until after his death; neither was his &ldquo;Refutation
of Malebranche,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Letters to the King,&rdquo; treatise
on the &ldquo;Authority of the Sovereign Pontiff,&rdquo; &ldquo;Questions
for Self-Examination on the Duties of a
King,&rdquo; &ldquo;Letters on Religion&rdquo; to the Duke of Orleans,
&ldquo;Plans of Government,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Letter to the
Academy.&rdquo; The latter, written a few months before
his death, constitutes his answer to the chief
literary questions of his age, and treats more especially
of the controversy between the Classic and
Romantic Schools. He was a thoroughgoing
Classicist, an Ancient of the Ancients, insisting on
the study of Greek as a panacea for most literary
diseases. He has also in the letter a chapter on
the &ldquo;Art of Writing History,&rdquo; making symmetry the
first requirement, and impartiality next. In his eyes
a history was a work of art, with something in it
of the epic poem. He suggested, furthermore, that
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
the Academy should devote itself to a detailed examination
of the standard works in the French language,
and prepare popular editions with notes.</p>
<p>All F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s writings, it may be said, show
much grandeur and delicacy of sentiment, great fertility
of genius, a correct taste, and excited sensibility.
A poetical character appears in them all.
By assiduous study the works of the best writers
of antiquity were familiar to him, and his intimate
acquaintance with their productions furnished him
a resource in every vicissitude of life; they were
his ornament in prosperity, his comfort in adversity.
The charm of his manner in society is largely communicated
to the products of his pen. They abound
in passages of splendor and pathos, but their chief
excellence is in their tender simplicity, by which
the reader&rsquo;s heart is irresistibly drawn to the writer.</p>
<p>Of much higher rank in a literary point of view
than any of those previously mentioned was his
&ldquo;Adventures of Telemachus; or, The Education of
a Prince.&rdquo; It is a fabulous narrative in the form of
a heroic poem, in which he sets down the truths
most necessary to be known by one about to reign;
and the faults that cling most closely to sovereign
power are also fully described. It was composed by
F&eacute;nelon while he was preceptor to the royal dukes,
and designed exclusively for their instruction;
&ldquo;written at chance moments, hurriedly, and piece
by piece,&rdquo; says the author, &ldquo;sent to the press by an
unfaithful copyist, and never intended for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
world.&rdquo; He insisted that he did not borrow from
real persons, or sketch in the characters of his own
time. This was undoubtedly true; but no human
power could convince Louis XIV that it was so,
and the unauthorized publication of it in 1698, just
when the Quietist controversy was at its height,
was extremely unfortunate for F&eacute;nelon, and filled
the king&rsquo;s cup of wrath to overflowing. He had
been more than sufficiently embittered before, but
after this there was not the slightest hope of reconciliation;
for the book is an idealistic portrayal of
a commonwealth where virtue has its own again,
where there is no tyranny, where the king is the
father of all his people and the chief servant of the
State, where duty is lifted far above rights, and
justice is supreme. Since nothing could be more
opposite to all this than the character and conduct
of King Louis, it is no wonder that he took it as a
personal insult and a deliberate satire. In every
part of it disrespectful mention is made of ambition,
of extensive conquests, of military fame, of
magnificence, and of almost everything else which
Louis considered as the glory of his reign. While
the author must be acquitted of any intention to
affront the monarch, which would have been most
ungrateful and most ridiculous, it is evident that
he must have had unconsciously in mind the principal
actors in the scenes around him, was wholly
out of sympathy with them, and was training the
young princes on a totally different model. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
book, suppressed, of course, in Paris, was brought
out at once in Holland, and became everywhere the
rage, immensely popular all over Europe, and, even
to the present day, much read. It has stood the test
of two centuries of existence, has been translated
into many languages, and has made his name familiar
to those whom he could not otherwise have
touched. Nevertheless, the effect of its publication
on his fortunes at that time was exceedingly disastrous,
and his enemies made the utmost use of it
against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Explanation of the Maxims of the Saints
on the Interior Life,&rdquo; and the great part it played in
F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s career has been already referred to in a
previous chapter. The reader will enjoy getting a
little fuller idea of its contents. Dr. T. C. Upham
devoted forty-five pages to summarizing, in a free
translation, the forty-five articles constituting the
book, and the following extracts are taken from his
work, now out of print:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure love is mixed love carried to its true result.
When this result is attained, the motive of
God&rsquo;s glory so expands itself, and so fills the mind,
that the other motive, that of our own happiness, becomes
so small and so recedes from our inward notice
as to be <i>practically</i> annihilated. It is then that
God becomes what He ever ought to be,&mdash;the center
of the soul, to which all its affections tend; the great
moral sun of the soul, from which all its light and
all its warmth proceed. It is then that a man thinks
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
no more of himself. He has become the man of a
single eye. His own happiness and all that regards
himself are entirely lost sight of, in his simple and
fixed look to God&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the sun shines the stars disappear.
When God is in the soul, who can think of himself?
So that we love God and God alone; and all other
things <i>in</i> and <i>for</i> God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second state, which follows that of holy
resignation, is that of holy <i>indifference</i>. Such a
soul not only desires and wills in submission, but
absolutely ceases either to desire or to will, except
in co-operation with the Divine leading. Its desires
for itself, as it has greater light, are more completely
and permanently merged in the one higher
and more absorbing desire of God&rsquo;s glory, and the
fulfillment of His will. It desires and wills, therefore,
only what God desires and wills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy indifference is not inactivity. It is the
furthest possible from it. It is indifference to anything
and everything out of God&rsquo;s will; but it is the
highest life and activity to everything in that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the principles in the doctrine of holy
living is, that we should not be premature in drawing
the conclusion that the process of inward crucifixion
is complete, and that our abandonment to God
is without any reservation whatever. The act of
consecration, which is a sort of incipient step, may
be sincere; but the reality of the consecration in
the full extent to which we suppose it to exist, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
which may properly be described as abandonment
or entire self-renunciation, can be known only when
God has applied the appropriate tests. We can not
know whether we have renounced ourselves, except
by being tried on those very points to which our
self-renunciation relates. The trial will show
whether or not we are wholly the Lord&rsquo;s. Those
who prematurely draw the conclusion that they are
so, expose themselves to great illusion and injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those in the highest state of religious experience
desire nothing except that God may be glorified
in them by the accomplishment of His holy will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their continual life of love, which refers everything
to God, and identifies everything with His
will, is essentially a life of continual prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The will of God is their ultimate and only rule
of action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most advanced souls are those which are
most possessed with the thoughts and the presence
of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soul in the state of pure love acts in simplicity.
Its inward rule of action is found in the
decisions of a sanctified judgment. These decisions,
based upon judgments that are free from self-interest,
may not always be <i>absolutely</i> right, because our
views and judgments, being limited, can extend only
to things in part; but they may be said to be <i>relatively</i>
right; they conform to things so far as we
are permitted to see them and understand them, and
convey to the soul a moral assurance that, when we
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
act in accordance with them, we are doing as God
would have us do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We come now to the &ldquo;Spiritual Letters,&rdquo; which
have been called, not unadvisedly, &ldquo;the most perfect
things of their kind anywhere to be found.&rdquo;
They were written to a very large number of correspondents,
both men and women, on the impulse
of the moment, and without the least thought of
publication. Hence they become all the more the
most authentic revelation of his inmost mind, a
necessary and integral part of his character. He
wrote as he would have spoken, suiting himself to
the knowledge of his hearers, aiming at simplicity
rather than ornament, but not disdaining homely
similes so far as they will make his meaning plain.
He draws freely and constantly upon his own experience,
so that the letters are a reflection of himself,
as well as a storehouse of practical religion.
Helpful counsel may be found in them for nearly
all situations in life and on nearly all topics that
are most closely connected with Christian living.
For though the persons to whom he wrote were
usually in the higher circles&mdash;dukes, counts, lords,
ladies, soldiers, courtiers, and priests&mdash;nevertheless,
they were always men and women, wives and
mothers, with human hearts and much the same
temptations to combat that come to common people
in the present age. The letters were written to meet
the individual needs of very real persons, written
out of a warm heart and by a mind stored with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
lore of the Church on these subjects, as well as
gifted with unusual powers of discernment. F&eacute;nelon
was a consummate director of consciences; he
moved through life heavily incumbered with the
wants of others, carrying many burdens and taxing
all his great powers to meet the ever-recurring
needs of a multitude of perplexed and hungering
spirits.</p>
<p>Those who peruse the epistles will readily perceive
that they present a very high ideal, yet we do
not think they can fairly be pronounced harsh. He
does not speak in a tone of asperity. He saw far
into the human heart, looked with a piercing eye
through the disguises of sin, could follow with unexampled
clearness the turnings and twistings and
lurkings of selfishness. Though the severest of censors,
he is at the same time the most pitying. He
regards human error with indulgent tenderness, and
weeps over it as Jesus wept over Jerusalem. Echoes
of the Stoic philosophers&mdash;Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus,
Seneca&mdash;will undoubtedly be found in these
letters. Indeed, a very considerable and rather
curious parallel has been drawn between F&eacute;nelon
and Seneca; which only shows the permanence of
the principles that regulate the union between God
and the soul under all skies and creeds. There is a
close similarity between these letters and those of
Francis of Sales, who wrote on the same themes;
for the two saw eye to eye. The effusions of either
Francis, although adapted primarily to a different
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
communion and time, can be recommended almost
unqualifiedly to-day to that small class&mdash;it will always
be a small class&mdash;who set themselves, with
an aroused intelligence, a high appreciation of the
nature of the task before them, and an intense determination,
to realize, through all available and
appointed means, the closest possible approximation
to perfect union with the Divine.</p>
<p>Our criticisms of F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s letters are but few,
and yet a little note of warning should undoubtedly
be sounded. No one should read them who is not
prepared to think for himself, to use a vigorous
common-sense, and to select for entire observance
only those precepts which commend themselves to
his mind as being in complete accord with the Scripture
and with the most judicious of other spiritual
advisers. Almost everything he finds will, we believe,
thus commend itself. But there will be an
occasional use of language before which he will
pause and make a note of question or dissent. There
will be unguarded expressions which need explanation.
Perhaps the chief words which he will find
cause to challenge will be those of most frequent occurrence&mdash;self
and self-love. F&eacute;nelon does not use
these terms quite accurately, and whoever takes
them literally will be led into trouble. Where he
says self-love he almost always means selfishness,
which, in our modern nomenclature, is quite a different
thing, being the inordinate, excessive, or forbidden
love of self, such a regard for the interests
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
and rights of self as disregards the interests and
rights of other people. This latter is always wrong,
of course. But self-love, strictly speaking, is in
itself right, perfectly innocent, and of great importance
to retain. It is essential to our preservation
and prosperity, one of the most vital ingredients
in our constitution. F&eacute;nelon, we think, never recognizes
this meaning of the word, never seems to
know that we have very important, imperative duties
to self, as well as to our neighbor and to God.
Either he was not familiar with these distinctions so
common in ethics now, or he was so profoundly
impressed with the danger of overdoing self-love
that he did not deem it well to recognize this duty
at all. But that surely is a mistake, and with some
minds tends to become a very harmful one, leading
straight on to fanaticism.</p>
<p>He is never tired of insisting on the absolute
necessity for the death of self, the destruction of
self. But this phrase will not stand critical examination.
The peril which always lurks in figures
of speech, and the tendency to exaggerate which so
frequently besets devotional writers of the intense
mystic type, is very manifest here. Such writers
put forward their extreme statements with a laudable
desire to make a deep impression on the callous
sensibilities of the average reader, and with the idea,
perhaps, that large deduction will be made in the
practical application of their precepts. But many
find in this an excuse for throwing the whole subject
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
impatiently aside. We are convinced that it is
better in such things to state the exact truth with
all carefulness and with as few misleading figures
of speech as possible. There is certainly an ethical
limit to our right of self-abnegation and self-impartation.
Benevolence has its moral bounds in holiness.
A man&rsquo;s life finds its largest fulfillment, not
in weakly assimilating itself to the wishes of those
around it, but in giving forth some new and characteristic
expression of the life of God. The notions,
or even the needs, of one&rsquo;s neighbors are not the
highest standard of right living. Every man holds
himself in trust for his Creator, and must do his
best to manifest that Creator, not necessarily according
to the conception most prevalent in his immediate
circle, but according to the mandate which
has been laid on him. It is this thought which gives
the profoundest value to his existence and lifts him
above too great dependence on popular standards.
And it is this thought, properly carried out, which
shows how much of unreason there is in the declaration
that self must be totally forgotten, renounced,
annihilated.</p>
<p>No person is justified in doing anything of this
sort. Self-preservation and self-protection, self-respect
and self-esteem, self-defense and self-development
are manifest duties. It may readily be
granted that they are not in any great danger of
neglect from the ordinary or average individual.
But the extraordinary individual, if wrongly instructed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
filled with a zeal not according to knowledge,
keenly conscientious, morbidly scrupulous,
keyed up to an unnatural pitch and straining after
an impossible ideal, may do himself much harm and
go far astray. To overdo is often as bad as to underdo,
and causes undoing.</p>
<p>Denunciations of selfishness are always in order,
but its boundaries are not so easily defined. Self-love&mdash;the
instinctive desire or tendency that leads
one to seek to promote his own well-being, a due
care for one&rsquo;s own happiness, essential to high endeavor
and perfectly compatible with justice, generosity,
and benevolence&mdash;is a component part of
our nature, and must be carefully safeguarded. To
talk about its annihilation or eradication is to talk
foolishness; and to attempt such eradication is to fly
in the face of nature; that is, of God. The whole
question, then, between selfishness and self-love is
one of degree and adjustment and relative rights.
No absolute hard-and-fast line can be drawn. One
must use his best judgment, enlightened from all
possible sources, as to what in any given case duty
to self and duty to others demands. And that judgment
he must follow, even when it materially differs
from the opinion of those who may criticise his
conduct. There is no virtue in wasting one&rsquo;s self
on impossible tasks. Self-sacrifice is never ethical
if it be a willful spending of self to no purpose.
One may do a serious wrong to himself, and confer
no real good on any one else, by following the lead
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
of generous, uncalculating, unthinking impulses.
The exhortation never to think about one&rsquo;s self is
thoroughly mischievous, and can only lead to fanaticism
and discouragement.</p>
<p>Self-control, not self-annihilation or extirpation,
is the duty of the Christian. A man has perfect self-control
when his highest powers hold the lower in
subjection with perfect ease, and are themselves in
complete harmony with the will of God. He is perfectly
free from selfishness who gives to self only
that degree of attention and care which is due, and
in no way infringes on any of the rights of others.
And he who is keenly desirous of doing this, bearing
in mind his natural bias the wrong way, will
deem it the safer course to go a little beyond what
may seem the due limit. But it is not selfish to be
manly, or to insist on being permitted to work out
one&rsquo;s calling according to the clear, conscious summons
from on high. Self-will so much inveighed
against is right, since it is a necessary component
part of selfhood. Without self-will and self-consciousness
there can be no self; in other words, we
cease to be, and are non-existent. Masterfulness
should be distinguished from willfulness; the former
is not sinful, but a most desirable thing in this world
where leadership is so essential to progress. A selfish
will, one at any point divergent from the will of
God, so far as we know or can ascertain, is always
wrong. To tell where egoism ends and altruism begins
in our relations with our fellow-men is far from
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
easy; but it is ever blessed to become absorbed in a
great cause, and supremely noble to have as the
highest object in life the glory of God.</p>
<p>Some exceptions must be taken to a few other
extreme statements of F&eacute;nelon, in which he follows
other mistaken writers. The language of such
teachers on humility is overstrained and really
false, likely to do harm. F&eacute;nelon says, for example,
&ldquo;Those who are truly humble always take the lowest
place, rejoicing when they are despised, and
considering every one superior to themselves. We
may judge of the advancement we have in humility
by the delight we have in humiliation and contempt.&rdquo;
His motto was, &ldquo;Ama nesciri&rdquo;&mdash;Love to
be unknown. Kempis wrote much of this same sort.
And John Fletcher of Madeley was constantly offering
up the prayer which we have in Charles Wesley&rsquo;s
couplet,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Make me little and unknown,</p>
<p class="t0">Loved and prized by God alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>To desire to be despised, thought meanly of, accounted
as naught, we can not recognize as a fruit
of grace in a healthy mind rightly apprehensive of
the vast importance to usefulness of a good reputation.
To think of ourselves more highly than we
ought to think is wrong, but so is it wrong to think
of ourselves less highly than we ought. The truth
above all things, facts at any cost whether to ourselves
or other people, is the better attitude. No
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
gain can come from falsity on the one side, any
more than on the other. To delight unspeakably in
the will of God, even when it involves contempt
from those who misunderstand our position, is not
the same as delighting in contempt itself. To insist
on the lowest place when our recognized and lawful
place is higher, would be neither wise nor edifying.
F&eacute;nelon himself took his proper place as archbishop
in the cathedral and palace and elsewhere, without
diminution from his humility. He showed the latter
in his hospital work, and in his familiar relations
with those of lower rank.</p>
<p>A little too much is made in some places of the
importance of silence. There is not sufficient recognition
of the fact that some are in great danger of
speaking too little, that there are idle silences as
well as idle words. The stress laid upon listening
to the interior voice is also carried somewhat beyond
bounds, and needs counterbalancing by the
warning that it is very easy to mistake the utterances
of our own spirits for those of the Spirit of
God, the products of a vain imagination for the
products of Divine direction. Many have been sadly
misled at this point. We need not perhaps specify
other strained and unbalanced remarks. There are
not many of them, and it would be unjust to make
too much of them; but it is also unsafe to ignore
them altogether. The letters are all the better in
that they demand reflection from the reader, and
are not to be taken up in a wooden way as though
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
they were infallible. Properly perused, with prayer
and meditation, they can not fail to be of immense
service to the inquiring mind and the devotional
spirit. There is nothing better as a stimulus to
those with lofty aspirations seeking for guidance as
to how best they may reach the heights.</p>
<p>A few extracts from the letters, all that our
space permits, are furnished, that the reader&rsquo;s appetite
may be whetted for the feast to be found in
larger volumes. And we can not better close this
unpretentious, but we hope useful, little book than
with some of the glowing paragraphs that have
already done so much good in the world, and are
destined to do so much more as the centuries roll:</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Easy Ways of Divine Love.</span></h3>
<p>Christian perfection is not that rigorous, tedious,
cramping thing that many imagine. It demands
only an entire surrender of everything to God, from
the depths of the soul; and the moment this takes
place, whatever is done for Him becomes easy.
They who are God&rsquo;s without reserve are in every
state content; for they will only what He wills, and
desire to do for Him whatever He desires them to
do. They strip themselves of everything, and in
this nakedness find all things a hundred-fold. Peace
of conscience, liberty of spirit, the sweet abandonment
of themselves and theirs into the hands of
God, the joy of perceiving the light always increasing
in their hearts, and, finally, the freedom of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
souls from the bondage of the fears and desires of
this world,&mdash;these things constitute that return of
happiness which the true children of God receive a
hundred-fold in the midst of their crosses while
they remain faithful.</p>
<p>What God requires of us is a will which is no
longer divided between Him and any creature; a
simple pliable state of will, which desires what He
desires, rejects nothing but what He rejects, wills
without reserve what He wills, and under no pretext
wills what He does not. In this state of mind
all things are proper for us; our amusements, even,
are acceptable in His sight.</p>
<p>No matter what crosses may overwhelm the true
child of God, he wills everything that happens, and
would not have anything removed that his Father
appoints; the more he loves God, the more is he
filled with content; and the most stringent perfection,
far from being a burden, only renders his yoke
the lighter.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Divine Presence.</span></h3>
<p>The true source of all our perfection is contained
in the command of God to Abraham, &ldquo;Walk
before me and be thou perfect.&rdquo; (Gen. xvii, 1.) The
presence of God calms the soul, and gives it quiet
and repose, even during the day and in the midst
of occupation; but we must be given up to God
without reserve.</p>
<p>Whenever we perceive within us anxious desires
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
for anything, whatever it may be, and find that nature
is hurrying us with too much haste to do whatever
is to be done, whether it be to say something,
see something, or do something, let us stop short
and repress the precipitancy of our thoughts and
the agitation of our actions; for God has said that
His Spirit does not dwell in disquiet.</p>
<p>An excellent means of preserving our interior
solitude and liberty of soul is to make it a rule to
put an end at the close of every action to all reflections
upon it, all reflex acts of self-love, whether
of a vain joy or sorrow.</p>
<p>Let us be accustomed to recollect ourselves, during
the day and in the midst of our occupations, by
a simple view of God. Let us silence by that means
all the movements of our heart, when they appear
in the least agitated. Let us separate ourselves from
all that does not come from God. Let us suppress
our superfluous thoughts and reveries. Let us utter
no useless word. Let us seek God within us, and
we shall find Him without fail, and with Him joy
and peace.</p>
<p>Let us be careful not to suffer ourselves to be
overwhelmed by the multiplicity of our exterior
operations, be they what they may. Let us endeavor
to commence every enterprise with a pure
view to the glory of God, continue it without distraction,
and finish it without impatience. The intervals
of relaxation and amusement are the most
dangerous for us, and perhaps the most useful for
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
others; we must then be on our guard that we be as
faithful as possible to the presence of God. We can
never employ our leisure hours better than in refreshing
our spiritual strength by a secret and intimate
communion with God. Prayer is so necessary
and the source of so many blessings, that he
who has discovered the treasure can not be prevented
from having recourse to it whenever he has
an opportunity.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Independence.</span></h3>
<p>Do not suffer yourself to get excited by what is
said about you. Let the world talk. Do you strive
to do the will of God; as for that of men, you would
never succeed in doing it to their satisfaction, and
it is not worth the pains.</p>
<p>Let the water flow beneath the bridge. Let men
be men; that is to say, weak, vain, inconsistent, unjust,
false, and presumptuous. Let the world be
the world still; you can not prevent it. Let every
one follow his own inclination and habits: you can
not recast them, and the best course is to let them
be as they are and bear with them. Do not think it
strange when you witness unreasonableness and injustice;
rest in peace in the bosom of God: He sees
it all more clearly than you do, and yet permits it.
Be content to do quietly and gently what it becomes
you to do, and let everything else be to you as
though it were not.</p>
<p>As long as the world is anything to us, so long
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
our freedom is but a word, and we are as easily
captured as a bird whose leg is fastened by a thread.
He seems to be free; the string is not visible, but he
can fly only its length, and he is a prisoner.</p>
<p>Do not be vexed at what people say. Let them
speak while you endeavor to do the will of God. A
little silence, peace, and communion with God will
compensate you for all the injustice of men. We
must love our fellow-beings without depending on
their friendship. They leave us, they return, and
they go from us again. Let them go or come; it
is the feather blown about by the wind. Fix your
attention upon God alone in your connection with
them. It is He alone who, through them, consoles
or afflicts you.</p>
<p>Possess your soul in patience. Renew often
within you the feeling of the presence of God, that
you may learn moderation. There is nothing truly
great but lowliness, charity, fear of ourselves, and
detachment from the dominion of sense. Accustom
yourself gradually to carry prayer into your daily
occupations. Speak, move, act in peace as if you
were in prayer. Do everything without eagerness
as if by the Spirit of God. As soon as you perceive
your natural impetuosity impelling you, retire into
the sanctuary where dwells the Father of spirits;
listen to what you hear there; and then neither say
nor do anything but what He dictates in your heart.
You will find that you will become more tranquil,
that your words will be fewer and more to the purpose,
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
and that with less effort you will accomplish
more good. When the heart is fixed on God it can
easily accustom itself to suspend the natural movements
of ardent feeling, and to wait for the favorable
moment when the voice within may speak. This
is the continual sacrifice of self, and the life of
faith.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Faults of Others.</span></h3>
<p>Perfection is easily tolerant of the imperfections
of others; it becomes all things to all men. We
must not be surprised at the greatest defects in good
souls, and must quietly let them alone until God
gives the signal of gradual removal; otherwise we
shall pull up the wheat with the tares.</p>
<p>They who correct others ought to watch the
moment when God touches their hearts; we must
bear a fault with patience till we perceive His Spirit
reproaching them within. We must imitate Him
who gently reproves, so that they feel that it is less
God that condemns them than their own hearts.
When we blame with impatience, because we are
displeased with the fault, it is a human censure and
not the disapprobation of God. It is a sensitive self-love
that can not forgive the self-love of others.
The more self-love we have, the more severe our
censures. There is nothing so vexatious as the collisions
between one excessive self-love and another
still more violent and excessive. The passions of
others are infinitely ridiculous to those who are
under the dominion of their own. The ways of
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
God are very different. He is ever full of kindness
for us; He gives us strength; He regards us with
pity and condescension; He remembers our weakness;
He waits for us.</p>
<p>I am very sorry for the imperfections you find
in human beings, but you must learn to expect but
little from them; this is the only security against
disappointment. We must receive from them what
they are able to give us, as from trees the fruits
that they yield. God bears with imperfect beings
even when they resist His goodness. We ought to
imitate this merciful patience and endurance. It
is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect.
The more perfect we are, the more gentle
and quiet we become toward the defects of others.</p>
<p>The defects of our neighbors interfere with our
own; our vanity is wounded by that of another; our
own haughtiness finds our neighbor&rsquo;s ridiculous and
insupportable; our restlessness is rebuked by the
sluggishness and indolence of this person; our
gloom is disturbed by the gayety and frivolity of
that person; and our heedlessness by the shrewdness
and address of another. If we were faultless
we should not be so much annoyed by the defects
of those with whom we associate. If we were to
acknowledge honestly that we have not virtue
enough to bear patiently with our neighbor&rsquo;s weaknesses,
we should show our own imperfection, and
this alarms our vanity. We therefore make our
weakness pass for strength, elevate it to a virtue,
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
and call it zeal. For it is not surprising to see how
tranquil we are about the errors of others when they
do not trouble us, and how soon this wonderful zeal
kindles against those who excite our jealousy or
weary our patience.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Not Perfect in a Moment.</span></h3>
<p>Neither in His gracious nor providential dealings
does God work a miracle lightly. It would be as
great a wonder to see a person full of self become
in a moment dead to all self-interest and all sensitiveness
as it would be to see a slumbering infant
wake in the morning a fully developed man. God
works in a mysterious way in grace as well as in
nature, concealing His operations under an imperceptible
succession of events, and thus keeps us always
in the darkness of faith.</p>
<p>He makes use of the inconstancy and ingratitude
of the creature, and of the disappointments and
surfeits which accompany prosperity, to detach us
from them both. All this dealing appears perfectly
natural, and it is by this succession of natural
means that we are burnt as by a slow fire. We
should like to be consumed at once by the flames of
pure love; but such an end would cost us scarce
anything. It is only an excessive self-love that desires
thus to become perfect in a moment, and at so
cheap a rate.</p>
<p>We cling to an infinity of things which we never
suspect; we only feel that they are a part of us
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
when they are snatched away, as I am only conscious
that I have hairs when they are pulled from
my head. God develops to us little by little what is
within us, of which we are until then entirely ignorant,
and we are astonished at discovering in our
very virtues defects of which we should never have
believed ourselves capable.</p>
<p>God spares us by discovering our weakness to
us in proportion as our strength to support the view
of it increases. We discover our imperfections one
by one as we are able to cure them. Without this
merciful preparation that adapts our strength to the
light within, we should be in despair.</p>
<p>To the sincere desire to do the will of God
we must add a cheerful spirit that is not overcome
when it has failed, but tries again and again to do
better; hoping always to the very end to be able to
do it; bearing with its own involuntary weakness as
God bears with it; waiting with patience for the
moment when it shall be delivered from it; going
straight on in singleness of heart according to the
strength that it can command; losing no time by
looking back, nor making useless reflections when it
falls, which can only embarrass and retard its progress.
The first sight of our little failings should
humble us, but we must press on; not judging ourselves
with a Judaical rigor; not regarding God as
a spy watching for our least offense, or as an enemy
who places snares in our path, but as a Father who
loves and wishes to save us; trusting in His goodness,
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
invoking His blessing, and doubting all other
support. This is true liberty.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Humility.</span></h3>
<p>The foundation of peace with all men is humility.
Pride is incompatible with pride; hence arise divisions
in the world. We must stifle all rising jealousies;
all little contrivances to promote our own
glory; vain desires to please or to succeed, or to be
praised; the fear of seeing others preferred to ourselves;
the anxiety to have our plans carried into
effect; the natural love of dominion and desire to
influence others. These rules are soon given, but
it is not so easy to observe them. With some people,
not only pride and hauteur render these duties very
difficult, but great natural sensitiveness makes the
practice of them nearly impossible, and, instead of
respecting their neighbor with a true feeling of
humility, all their charity amounts only to a sort
of compassionate toleration that nearly resembles
contempt.</p>
<p>Humility is the source of all true greatness;
pride is ever impatient, ready to be offended. He
who thinks nothing is due to him never thinks himself
ill-treated; true meekness is not mere temperament,
for this is only softness or weakness.</p>
<p>There is no true and constant gentleness without
humility; while we are so fond of ourselves we are
easily offended with others. Let us be persuaded
that nothing is due to us, and then nothing will disturb
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
us. Let us often think of our own infirmities,
and we shall become indulgent toward those of
others.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Daily Faults.</span></h3>
<p>Little faults become great in our eyes in proportion
as the pure light of God increases in us, just
as the sun in rising reveals the true dimensions of
objects which were dimly and confusedly discovered
during the night. Be sure that, with the increase
of the inward light, the imperfections which
you have hitherto seen will be beheld as far greater
and more deadly in their foundations than you now
conceive them, and that you will witness, in addition,
the development of a crowd of others, of the
existence of which you have not now the slightest
suspicion. You will find the weaknesses necessary
to deprive you of all confidence in your own
strength; but this discovery, far from discouraging,
will but serve to destroy your self-reliance, and raze
to the ground the edifice of pride.</p>
<p>Our faults, even those most difficult to bear, will
all be of service to us if we make use of them for
our humiliation without relaxing our efforts to correct
them. We must bear with ourselves without
either flattery or discouragement, a mean seldom attained.
Utter despair of ourselves, in consequence
of a conviction of our helplessness and unbounded
confidence in God, is the true foundation of the
spiritual edifice.</p>
<p>Discouragement is not a fruit of humility, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
of pride; nothing can be worse. Suppose we have
stumbled, or even fallen, let us rise and run again;
all our falls are useful if they strip us of a disastrous
confidence in ourselves, while they do not take
away a humble and salutary trust in God.</p>
<p>Carefully purify your conscience from daily
faults; suffer no sin to dwell in your heart; small
as it may seem, it obscures the light of grace, weighs
down the soul, and hinders that constant communion
with Jesus Christ which it should be your pleasure
to cultivate; you will become lukewarm, forget God,
and find yourself growing in attachment to the
creature. The great point is never to act in opposition
to the inward light, but be willing to go as
far as God would have us.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Motives.</span></h3>
<p>God does not so much regard our actions as the
motives of love from which they spring, and the
pliability of our wills to His. Men judge our deeds
by their outward appearance; with God, that which
is most dazzling in the eyes of men is of no account.
What He desires is a pure intention, a will ready
for anything and ever pliable in His hands, and an
honest abandonment of self; and all this can be
much more frequently manifested on small than on
extraordinary occasions; there will also be much
less danger from pride, and the trial will be far
more searching. Indeed, it sometimes happens that
we find it harder to part with a trifle than with an
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
important interest; it may be more of a cross to
abandon a vain amusement than to bestow a large
sum in charity.</p>
<p>The greatest danger of all consists in this, that
by neglecting small matters the soul becomes accustomed
to unfaithfulness. We grieve the Holy
Spirit, we return to ourselves, we think it a little
thing to be wanting toward God. On the other
hand, true love can see nothing small; everything
that can either please or displease God seems to be
great. Not that true love disturbs the soul with
scruples, but it puts no limit to its faithfulness; it
acts simply with God; and as it does not concern
itself about those things which God does not require
from it, so it never hesitates an instant about
those which He does, be they great or small.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">True Prayer.</span></h3>
<p>True prayer is only another name for the love of
God. To pray is to desire&mdash;but to desire what God
would have us desire. He who asks what he does
not from the bottom of his heart desire, is mistaken
in thinking that he prays. O how few there are who
pray; for how few are they who desire what is truly
good! Crosses, external and internal humiliation,
renouncement of our own wills, the death of self,
and the establishment of God&rsquo;s throne upon the
ruins of self-love,&mdash;these are indeed good. Not to
desire these is not to pray; to desire them seriously,
soberly, constantly, and with reference to all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
details of life,&mdash;this is true prayer. Alas! how
many souls full of self and of an imaginary desire
for perfection in the midst of hosts of voluntary
imperfections, have never yet uttered this true
prayer of the heart! It is in reference to this that
St. Augustine says, &ldquo;He that loveth little, prayeth
little; he that loveth much, prayeth much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our intercourse with God resembles that with
a friend; at first there are a thousand things to be
told and as many to be asked; but after a time these
diminish, while the pleasure of being together does
not. Everything has been said, but the satisfaction
of seeing each other, of feeling that one is near the
other, of reposing in the enjoyment of a pure and
sweet friendship, can be felt without conversation;
the silence is eloquent and mutually understood.
Each feels that the other is in perfect sympathy
with him, and that their two hearts are incessantly
poured out into each other, and constitute but one.</p>
<p>Those who have stations of importance to fill
have generally so many indispensable duties to perform
that, without the greatest care in the management
of their time, none will be left to be alone with
God. If they have ever so little inclination to dissipation,
the hours that belong to God and their
neighbor disappear altogether. We must be firm
in observing our rules. This strictness seems excessive,
but without it everything falls into confusion;
we become dissipated, relaxed, and lose
strength; we insensibly separate from God, surrender
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
ourselves to all our pleasures, and only then begin
to perceive that we have wandered when it is
almost hopeless to think of endeavoring to return.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">The Human Will.</span></h3>
<p>True virtue and pure love reside in the will
alone. The question is not, What is the state of
our feelings? But, What is the condition of our
will? Let us will to have whatever we have, and
not to have whatever we have not. We would not
even be delivered from our sufferings, for it is
God&rsquo;s place to apportion to us our crosses and our
joys. In the midst of affliction we rejoice, as did
the apostles; but it is not joy of the feelings, joy of
the will. The faithful soul has a will which is perfectly
free; it accepts without questioning whatever
bitter blessings God develops, wills them, loves them,
and embraces them; it would not be freed from
them if it could be accomplished by a simple wish;
for such a wish would be an act originating in self
and contrary to its abandonment to Providence; and
it is desirous that this abandonment should be absolutely
perfect.</p>
<p>The important question is, not how much you
enjoy religion, but whether you will whatever God
wills. The essence of virtue consists in the attitude
of the will. That kingdom of God which is
within us consists in our willing whatever God
wills, always, in everything, without reservation.
Thus nothing can ever come to pass against our
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
wishes; for nothing can happen contrary to the
will of God. The interior life is the beginning of
the blessed peace of the saints, who eternally cry,
Amen, Alleluia! We adore, we praise, we bless
God in everything; we see Him incessantly, and
in all things His paternal hand is the sole object of
our contemplation. There are no longer any evils;
for even the most terrible that can come upon us
work together for our good. Can the suffering that
God designs to purify us and make us worthy of
Himself be called an evil?</p>
<p>Happy is he who never hesitates; who fears only
that he follows with too little readiness; who would
rather do too much against self than too little.
Blessed is he who, when asked for a sample, boldly
presents his entire stock and suffers God to cut
from the whole cloth. It is thought that this state
is a painful one. It is a mistake; here is peace and
liberty; here the heart, detached from everything,
is immeasurably enlarged, so as to become illimitable;
nothing cramps it; and, in accordance with
the promise, it becomes, in a certain sense, one with
God Himself.</p>
<p>True progress does not consist in a multitude of
views, nor in austerities, trouble, and strife; it is
simply willing nothing and everything, without
reservation and choice, cheerfully performing each
day&rsquo;s journey as Providence appoints it for us:
seeking nothing, refusing nothing, finding everything
in the present moment, and suffering God,
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
who does everything, to do His pleasure in and by
us without the slightest resistance.</p>
<h3 class="center"><span class="sc">Various Advices.</span></h3>
<p>You may be exercised in self-renunciation in
every event of every day.</p>
<p class="tb">Peace in this life springs from acquiescence even
in disagreeable things, not in an exemption from
suffering.</p>
<p class="tb">Whoever will refuse nothing which comes in
the order of God, and seek nothing out of that order,
need never fear to finish his day&rsquo;s work without
partaking of the cross of Jesus Christ. There
is an indispensable providence for crosses as well
as for the necessaries of life; they are a part of our
daily bread; God will never suffer it to fail.</p>
<p class="tb">A life of faith produces two things: First, it
enables us to see God in everything; secondly, it
holds the mind in a state of readiness for whatever
may be His will. This continual, unceasing dependence
on God, this state of entire peace and acquiescence
of the soul in whatever may happen, is
the true silent martyrdom of self.</p>
<p class="tb">With the exception of sin, nothing happens in
this world out of the will of God. It is He who is
the author, ruler, and bestower of all; He has numbered
the hairs of our head, the leaves of every tree,
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
the sand upon the seashore, and the drops of the
ocean.</p>
<p class="tb">This is the whole of religion: to get out of self
in order to get into God.</p>
<p class="tb">To be a Christian is to be an imitator of Jesus
Christ. In what can we imitate Him if not in his
humiliation? Nothing else can bring us near to
Him. We may adore Him as omnipotent, fear Him
as just, love Him with all our heart as good and
merciful, but we can only imitate Him as humble,
submissive, poor, and despised.</p>
<p class="tb">What men stand most in need of is the knowledge
of God. It is not astonishing that men do so
little for God, and that the little which they do costs
them so much. They do not know Him; scarcely do
they believe that He exists. If He were known He
would be loved.</p>
<p class="tb">Thou causest me clearly to understand that
Thou makest use of the evils and imperfections of
the creature to do the good which Thou hast determined
beforehand. Thou concealest Thyself
under the importunate visitor who intrudes upon the
occupation of Thy impatient child, that he may
learn not to be impatient, and that he may die to the
gratification of being free to study or work as he
pleases. Thou availest Thyself of slanderous
tongues to destroy the reputation of Thine innocent
children, that, besides their innocence, they may
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
offer Thee the sacrifice of their too highly cherished
reputation. By the cunning artifices of the envious
Thou layest low the fortunes of those whose hearts
were too much set upon their prosperity. Thus
Thou mercifully strewest bitterness over everything
that is not Thyself, to the end that our hearts,
formed to love Thee and to exist upon Thy love,
may be, as it were, constrained to return to Thee by
a want of satisfaction in everything else.</p>

by this wonderful saying. It is fully in accord with the fact that the
most chivalrous and generous friendship is never concerned about
payment in kind, about what it shall get in return; it only asks the
privilege of loving and of pouring itself out unstintedly for its
beloved. Disinterestedness should not probably be pressed as a
requirement upon minds not capable of such heights, but it has a
grandeur that appeals sometimes to nearly all. This was especially
the case in an age when Jesuit cheapjacks were accustomed to
haggle with God for the price of the soul, and discuss whether it
was necessary to love Him once in a week or once in a year, or
whether salvation might not be purchased still more cheaply at the

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
